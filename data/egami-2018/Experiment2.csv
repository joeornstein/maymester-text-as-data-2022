0,"Assuming the person has never been imprisoned before because he/she hasn't commited any crime in the country he/she came from they should be treated respectfully and should only sentenced with probation.
Furthermore i think entering a non foreign country isn't really a """"bad"""" crime expect the person wants to commit some serious crimes or terroristic actions."
0,"While the offender must certainly be deported, he hasn't committed a jailable offense other than just being here. Still, without further information about the case in question it's hard to make a determination."
0,"He doesnt have a criminal past, send him back home"
1,"I honestly don't know. He hasnt committed a crime in the United States at this point, so he can't be jailed. By entering the country illegally he HAS committed a crime, so I would recommend that he be deported instead. "
0,"He is not of any true harm. He should be warned and sent back."
1,"I think he should just be deported."
1,"People who are violent criminals should not be allowed to enter our country illegally.  He should be prosecuted for entering illegally to show their are consequences for breaking US law."
0,"He should be deported not imprisoned. The only thing he did was illegal enter the country, why waste money keeping him in prison when you can simply deport him."
1,"I believe the subject in question should not be sent to prison, I believe they should be deported. They have already served prison and had been deported previously. This is a person that we should not be helping because they are clearly not the kind of person that would help us should the roles switch."
0,"I think we should look into investigating his for coming over. we she check to see how long he plans to stay. if we don't have the resources or funding to do that then we should send him back to his country."
1,"there should be actions taken by those who disobey the law regardless of who committed the crim. someone like this man should show testament to others that if you commit a crimee in another country, there will be punishmesns "
1,"He has broken the law once again, he should be sent back to prison to do some time. He has been in prison for other reasons and one of the time was for a violent crime. He has a history and evidence of repeating unlawful actions, he should be put in prison. Citizen or no citizen if you break the law in United States, you should serve the time that is appropriate by the unlawful action you had taken in U.S. "
1,"I dont have enough details to form an opinion.  I dont know what he was convicted for prior to getting caught and knowing our justice system was he treated fairly and with good defence."
1,"The offender has already served time in prison and has proven he is a violent person. He was deported before and re-entered the country and has committed another crime. I suggest two possible punishments, one, he should be sentenced to a very long prison term and then deported. A second term is to deport him to his native country and make sure he serves a long sentence in one of their prisons."
1,"Even though this person is a past offender I would not want that person kept in the country under any circumstance. He is not our problem and we should not have to house him."
0,"i don't think he should be sent to prison. I do think that he should be sent back to where he came from and be blacklisted from entering u.s. again."
1,"He should be deported back to the country where he came from.  Assuming the crimes were not committed in this country, why should taxpayers pay to prison him."
1,"I said no because he hadn't committed any crimes yet, other than entering the country illegally.  I think he should just be deported. "
0,"I don't think he should go to prison, since the only thing he did wrong was enter the country illegally.  He should probably be sent back home, and maybe explain to him the right way to come back."
0,"I think sending him to prison would be a waste of taxpayer money. I think he should be deported immediately."
0,"A worker had decided it was better to tell fellow inmates that he was in prison for a shooting & convicted of illegally entering."
1,"I think he should be deported again, because housing him in prison costs the country money that could be better spent on programs for citizens and infrastructure. Also, once released from prison he might just try to return to the country again. So if he's deported now, the country can save money (instead of housing him for years at great cost), and there's a small chance he might be deterred from trying to return to the country again. "
1,"First of all he was not willing to take the steps to enter the United States legally. He also had previously served multiple prison terms for violet crimes which resulted in his deportation. This man seems like a potentially dangerous individual who should not be left to roam free."
1,"I believe this person should go to prison/be deported again. Convictions of violent crime are more serious and he should not have a chance to become a citizen."
1,"I think this person should be sent to prison mainly for his previous convictions. If he had of not committed a violent crime prior, I would have been more lenient on the person. This person has a history of violating laws."
0,"The person should not be sent to prison. He/she should be processed and deported back to the country they came from."
1,"The phrase illegally entered would have not fully convinced me that this person needed to go to prison. The prior convictions indicates a pattern, unless a character witness can show these violent crimes were separated by many years and said person lived in a violent area where sometimes self defense is needed, this person should either be deported or go to prison."
1,"He has a record of violence and has already been deported clearly he will continue to repeat it over again. Yes he needs a punishment ."
1,"He illegally came into the United States, and have a record. He's a danger to society. He should be deported back, and be locked in a jail, in whatever country he is from."
0,"Deportation seems to be the natural way to handle this. Prisons are too crowded to have to handle such cases."
0,"We need more information before taking action, this an interview with ICE officials is the first step. What country is he from? Is he a political refugee? Is he fleeing other persecution such as religious or """"social"""" (is he LGBT?). Does he have family or loved ones in the US? 

Basically, many questions to be answered before deciding."
1,"He should be sent back to his country. No use in wasting resources if he isn't supposed to be here anyway"
0,"No, but he should be deported and sent back to where he came from. I don't think sneaking into the country should be punishable by prison time. "
0,"I think he should serve at least six month in prison. I feel like it is wrong to enter illegally into the country."
1,"The person committed a crime.  Period.  If an act is illegal, then the person committing the illegal act should be subject to the punishment associated with the crime.  There should not be special consideration for immigration status.  You come to this country, you commit a crime, you are subject to punishment for that crime."
0,"In my view he is entering  illegally to United States. That is not expected one as per US laws. If he has valid entry level permission then he is Ok."
1,"If he broke the law he should serve whatever the prison penalty is for this crime.  He entered the country illegally, so whatever the penalty for that crime is should be served."
0,"Without knowing the circumstances of his arrival it is somewhat difficult to determine punishment. My first reaction would be deportation. If he entered the country because of discrimination in his homeland I would attempt to find help for him."
1,"He has been coming to the US illegally and creating victims when he is here.  She should be sent to prison."
0,"I feel he should just be deported and not given jail time. Although illegally entering the country is a crime, I do not think it justifies a jail sentence. "
1,"They should be killed for violating multiple law both at home and abroad. Sending him back would set him free and prisoning him would but a burden on the tax payers of the other country."
0,"He broke the law by entering the United States illegally.  By breaking the law, he became a criminal.  Criminals should go to prison.  "
0,"HE SHOULD NOT BE PRISON ED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY ILLEGAL BACKGROUND OR PAST.HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN INNOCENT PERSON BUT IT IS ADVISABLE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY WITH LAST WARNING"
0,"I'm not sure because I don't know what kind of crime this man committed. If it was a petty crime then I would probably say no prison time and they should just be deported. because why would we pay to jail, feed, pay the prison guards, etc. for a petty crime of someone not even a citizen of our country. If it was however a violent crime then I would send them to prison according to the law, because I think other countries (some) aren't as strict as us and that violent person may just sneak back into the U.S. if deported and hurt someone else, and that seems more risky than just paying to incarcerate them for their crimes. At least then they can't hurt anyone else."
1,"I do believe that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. But that does not take into consideration change and growth. I believe that everyone is capable of change and growth so therefore I would need more before I would decide to sent them to prision"
0,"He should be sent to prison because he broke the law. The government should then deport him after he has done his time."
0,"This man should not be sent to prison because he has never done anything wrong before. He should be sent back to his country and told to legally apply for entry to the United States."
0,"The prison system is already over-crowded. I think that there could be a more effective deterrent than incarceration. The costs of imprisonment would be passed along to the tax payers, which is almost as bad as doing nothing about the illegal immigration."
0,"He hasn't done an offense that physically or mentally harmed anyone else, and he probably just wanted a better life. Deport him because he was caught, but that's it."
1,"Being here improperly is not a crime, so he should not be sent to prison. But if it's believed he poses a threat then he should be deported."
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison since there was no other crime along with entering the US. I think he should be referred to immigration to get started on the naturalization process."
1,"They have already served their time for the previous offense. They should just be expelled from the country."
0,"Because he committed a CRIME. He should be sent to jail for 30 days, and then immediately deported. "
1,"Should be held in prison until he can be sent back to his country."
1,"THE US GOVERNMENT WAS WONDERFUL GOVERNMENT"
0,"He's not a violent criminal. It would be wasting resources to put him in jail. He should be sent back. his information could be taken."
0,"He should be punished with imprisonment because he broke the law. Entering the country illegally should be considered a serious offense. After imprisonment, he should be deported."
0,"He broke the law and illegally entered the country.  There are legal ways to enter the US and he broke the law so he should go to jail."
0,"His behavior was illegal.  People who break the law should be punished, and he should spend at least a month in prison."
0,"The crime of illegally entering the USA does not warrant Prison time.  At the very worst he should be sent back to his home country but there may be a valid reason for entering illegally and he should be asked if he can provide one. Such as a family illness or the death of loved one and he may have been unable to obtain a visa in time."
1,"He has broken the law and there should be some punishment.  If he is sent home he will just come back."
1,"I think he should be deported, or punished only for the crime of entering the US illegally. I don't think the punishment is a prison sentence in the US, so he should be deported. His previous crimes and sentences are irrelevant."
0,"because he didn't hurt anyone. also, he's never done any crimes before, so he's just a normal person"
1,"He was convicted of illegally entering the U.S. He already has a record on him. I want to say,""""Yes."""" He should be put in prison, but I am conflicted. Part of me wants to say, """"No."""" Why should he get free meals and healthcare in America even though he is in prison. That is more freedom that most Americans have. I am conflicted. We could deport him back, however he can always come back..."
1,"It seems to me that this person needs to again be sent back to their own country again. They seem to not understand that they are not welcome here. I would make it very clear that if they are found in the United States again that he will go to federal prison."
0,"He should be deported immediately. Imprisonment would cost the taxpayers."
1,"He is an illegal immigrant and therefore he broke the law just still being in this country.  The fact that he committed two crimes, one of which had he deported back to his native country, should definitely be used against him in pressing charges against the illegal immigrant.  The US government should press charges against the man and deport him again."
0,"For first offenses of illegal immigration, they should just be deported back to their country, assuming this does not account for temporary being held until their release back to the country they came from.  I feel like this, also illegal immigration is a serious issue, is a pretty minor first offense and should be treated as such."
1,"This individual has a prior criminal history in the US as a prior felon, and has been deported previously.  He should be again immediately be deported to his home country, without any additional prison time in the US.  Placing this person in a US prison as a non-citizen only taxes the US penal system."
0,"This is the United States, we shouldn't punish someone for wanting a better life.The government should instead give him the materials needed to take the citizenship test, and if he fails three times then they should deport him"
1,"The U.S. government has created a situation where foreign individuals become criminals in their country through an attempt to move from one place to another, which I disagree with. People who have already served their sentences for past crimes should not still be considered criminals, so a prison sentence is not called for in this case."
0,"He doesn't have a bad record or any history of wrong-doing.  He should be sent back to his country or be allowed time to get the legal documents to remain in the country if possible."
0,"He does not have any prior offenses. I don't think illegal immigration is a major crime."
0,"he should be sent back to his country.Entering illegally is not a crime according to USA laws"
0,"He illegally came to United States"
1,"Repeat offender. He obviously does not understand what a good citizen is."
0,"I think he should, at most, be sent back to his home country with no other punishment needed. He should also be encouraged to try and emigrate legally, and given information as to how to go about doing so if he would like."
0,"He has no previous criminal history, due to this he should not face prison time, rather just deportation. Had he had a criminal record I would have recommended prison time."
1,"Cant make up my mind either way. I just dont know what id do."
0,"Because the law has been broken and that is the punishment. If society doesn't like that, the law itself needs to change."
1,"Because he was illegally coming to the U.S. He also was held for a violent crime. We don't need this type of unnecessary acts added to our country, the U.S. We have other problems to deal with."
1,"This offender should be sent to prison for a long time.   They are a violent repeat offender.   They should be behind bars.   If they are so intent on being in the US, then they should be held to the same standard of punishment as a citizen."
0,"This person should be sent to prison for breaking the law. Then after they get out of prison they should be sent back to their country. Because if an American citizen breaks the law we are punished for our crimes. We aren't given special treatment, we're are expected to obey American laws. Not imprisoning them is unfair to American citizens who obey the laws, and unfair to immigrants who come here legally. "
0,"Prisons are already overcrowded and what he did was out of desperation but not as bad as say, murder. The government should just deport him back to his country instead of putting the burden of looking after him in prison on the American tax payers."
0,"This man should not be sent to prison. He should be returned to his country."
0,"he should be deported and sent back to his home country.
if he wants to come to the US, he needs to follow the rules to do so"
1,"This Offender should be sent to prison, because of illegally entering the United States."
1,"All the prison system does is profit from marginalized people. Secondly, why are we investing so much energy splitting hairs over immigration when the majority of the people in the US live like they're in a third world country?"
0,"I do not believe the man should be sent to prison. If he's never committed any other crime, and has been contributing to our economy, I don't see why he can't be left alone. I don't think any action should be taken."
0,"They should not be sent to prison because that just costs taxpayers a lot of money. They should be sent back to the country they came from instead."
1,"This man was already sentenced to prison. He also came here illegally which is already against the law."
0,"I think that this persons information should be entered into a database and they should be deported to their country of origin."
0,"It isnt worth our money and time to send him to our prison system.  It would be worth sending him back to his country and let his country deal with it."
0,"I and many others were fortunate enough to be born in the United States, therefore we get to stay no matter what. It should not be the fault of the individual in where they are born. He has no prior history of committing any crimes. All should be given the life of freedom unless otherwise proved to not deserve it, as many that are born US citizens show themselves to be but get to remain as US citizens."
0,"he committed no other crime other than entering illegally. He did not kill any one."
1,"They should rehab him. Give him a good education."
0,"I don't think he should serve prison time, but that he should be sent back to his own country."
0,"The US government should detain the man for a specific period of time to ensure that he is not entering the country for the purpose of performing other illegal activities (such as drug smuggling, etc.). If his intention is established as non-threatening or non-criminal, he should be given the resources to stay and have the opportunity to earn his citizenship. "
1,"The precedent show that this person has abused the privilege or citizenship and cannot be so easily trusted."
0," nice experience good ,i like it very much such as nice"
0,"I believe that if this man hasn't been imprisoned before and not a repeated offender, I think his punishment should be to be deported IF he hasn't tried becoming a citizen in the US. He shows no signs he's done anything criminal wise, and probably just wants a better life. "
0,"He is here illegal. It is a crime"
0,"He should not be sent to prison. Deport him back to his own country. It is wrong to put him into the prison system at the taxpayers expense. Prisons have enough non-violent offenders doing time."
0,"I think they should be given the opportunity to become a u.s. citizen legally, and if they choose not the seek the legal way then they should be deported"
1,"To clarify, I understand that there are laws that may allow undocumented immigrants to be held for some time (e.g. before deportation) as a consequence of the act of immigration itself. But I do not think that this citizen should serve prison time for previous crimes for which he has already faced justice. Deportation is the maximum consequence that he could face and the only infraction in this country for which he has according to the law earned a punishment. But I'm no expert on immigration law so I could be wrong here."
0,"I do not believe it serves any purpose to arrest someone who has no criminal record for entering the country illegally. It would be better to subject them to a means test. Determine whether or not they will have the ability to support themselves in this country. If they can, grant them a path to citizenship. If not, then carry out a second test to determine if they are at risk of harm in their country of origin. If they are at risk, they should be allowed to remain.  If they are not at risk they should be deported."
0,"It would be more effective for the government to help the man become a U.S. citizen. He would then be able to work and contribute by paying taxes, instead of being in prison where he will just consume resources"
0,"Should find out why the man entered the country. Based on the reasons and facts we should then decide to either deport or begin the process of legal immigration. The USA was founded by immigration."
0,"The US should consider if he has family to reunite with and or a job that will allow him to provide for himself.  If he has family, and a source of income, then he should be given a temporary ID, so that we can keep tabs on the person and only deport if he commits some other crime in our country."
1,"Well I think he should be sent back to his own country and not allowed to come back again. He should not be here wasting our resources."
1,"This individual should be deported back to his home country. He has illegally entered the country and since he has a prior conviction for a violent offense he should not be allowed to stay.  I do not believe he should be jailed within our system for this. He has paid for his prior crimes with sentences."
1,"The man broke the law. Whether or not he had a prior record is of no concern to me. He broke a law and should be punished for it. That punishment is likely time in prison and then deportation, both acceptable options. "
1,"I believe that rather than sending him to prison he should be deporting back to his home country.  It doesn't make sense to me why tax payers should pay for him to be housed in a U.S. prison."
1,"If he didn't commit any crimes other than illegally entering the US, he should only be punished for that crime.  The US should deport him for entering the US illegally."
0,"Because he violated the law and entered the country in a wrong manner. So legal actions should be taken against him"
0,"I believe that this man should not be sent to prison because he has never had any previous criminal infractions on his record. He also did nothing wrong. There are murderers that we should be focusing on."
0,"He is just trying to make a better life for himself and family. The is no real damage done."
0,"He should be deported and given the information on how to correctly immigrate to the US."
1,"If he committed a violent crime then he should be kept apart from people until he is ready to return to society. Then he should go through the legal process of coming here."
0,"He should not be sent to prison but instead be deported to his home country. It would cost taxpayers too much money to have a non-citizen in prison."
1,"I think this person should be deported due to his criminal history.  I don't see why money should be spent on him in prison."
0,"While he did break the law by entering the country illegally there are more serious offenses that justify incarceration.  Did the person have any motive for what he did or was planning to do anything?"
0,"I don't know if he should go to prison.  I would have to consider a lot of factors.  Has he been working and contributing to the US or has he been getting assistance and living off the hard work and taxes of legal citizens. Would it be better is he is deported?"
0,"can't blame someone for wanting a better life. he didn't do anything wrong."
1,"They Are a threat. Lock em up."
0,"If the person didn't do anything but that they should  be sent back. No reason to fill our prisons with this type or build a camp for illegals"
1,"Although he is  a citizen of another country he has committed a crime here. He should serve a prison sentence then be deported again."
0,"If this person has no prior convictions, I don't believe they should be imprisoned solely for the immigration offense. The person should be evaluated to see whether they qualify for asylum or some other program that would allow them to remain in the country legally. If not, they should be deported, but not imprisoned. "
1,"If he was just convicted of entering the country illegally, a lifetime sentence seems excessive. He should be deported again, or be given a shorter scentence for enteriing illegally."
0,""
0,"If this person has never committed a crime before, then he perhaps should not go to prison, but he should be deported back to his original country. However, anyone that comes here illegally that is already known to be a criminal should definitely go to prison. The United States is not a charity for the rest of the world to abuse. "
0,"They should probably deport him. Prison seems a little harsh if this is his only crime."
1,"If he has already been in violation of the country's laws and statures, then we should be less lenient in handing out consequences. "
1,"Since the person has a rather long history of criminal actions, he should be imprisoned. He should all be deported back to his own coutry at a later stage for the same reason."
1,"He should be sent to prison because one of his previous crimes was for a violent offense. Also, he had already been deported previously and re-entered the country. So, for these reasons, he should serve time."
1,"The man should be held in prison before being deported. His home country should take him and if they don't then he should be held in prison. This man shouldn't be in the country and should leave as soon as possible."
1,"This person should be deported because one of his previous sentences was for a violent crime. If you're going to be in the U.S. illegally, the least you can do is take advantage of the opportunity and better the circumstances for you and your family. You shouldn't be here doing stupid things like trying to commit violent crimes."
0,"The United States should at worst deport this man.  Sending him to prison would just take up more resources from the country."
0,"I am no expert to give a solution to such a complex problem but prison is not the answer. The prisons are crowded and prisoners are treated like less than human being. Something else should be implemented to take care of situation like this. Someone who'd be paid thousands of dollars to find a solution and would have the expertise."
1,"He had committed a violent crime and had been deported because of it. He's had his chance, and he needs to be """"sent up"""" for a while. And if he does similar in future, he needs to be """"sent up"""" for a longer period of time--so that perhaps--he can learn his lesson."
1,"Because of illegal entry is the act of foreign nationals arriving in or crossing the borders into a country in violation of its immigration law. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. For the act of permanently staying in a country contrary to its laws."
0,"The person had never committed an offense before. If anything, he should be deported back to his own country. "
1,"I think he had previous offenses and that was ok. Why I believe he should be sent to prison was that they had to do with violent crime."
1,"Since the person had been previously deported from the United States and was also previously convicted of a violent crime, I think it's only reasonable that they serve a prison term for breaking the laws of the United States again. They should be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years. If it was the first time they entered the US illegally and had no previous crime record, then I think the course of action would be very different and they shouldn't serve any time."
0,"I don't think illegal immigration should be a crime if no violence occurred. It doesn't make sense to lock someone up for it."
0,""
1,"I think the government should look into the crimes of this individual and determine if he should be deported or not. I think if he is violent, then he should not be in the country. "
1,"If he commited a crime, then he should go to prison. A violent crime is something he shouldn't have been just deported with because most likely he will sneak back in."
1,"I do not believe illegally entering the country should be a crime worthy of imprisonment. Because he committed a crime that got him deported in the past, I feel he should be deported again as punishment. As the person was deported before, it seems that it would be logical to do the same, because it is still a valid punishment from his violent offense."
1,"I feel like the person being in the country illegally being in the United States, is a crime all by itself. And he had served two previous prison sentences each more than a year. One of these previous sentences was for a violent crime and that is a huge thing to be charged with. This person at least should be deported by the U.S government, and also serve jail time if he did a crime here, if not still deportation is the number one priority."
1,"He is a criminal on multiple counts. Keeping him in prison prevents him from committing another offense. He should be deported after his sentence and border patrols increased to keep people like him from returning to the United States. If he has a family, return them with him even if the children are American citizens. This keeps the family together but not here. "
1,"They could send him back to his country of origin.  We don't know that he committed any crime other than entering the country at this time, and he deserves the presumption of innocence we would give to any American citizen."
0,"Generally, I think he should be sent back to his own country without sending prison.  However, I think it would be best that the legal decision about him should be determined based on the reason why he entered in the United States by examining whether he should be sent to prison or sent to his own country."
0,"This country was built on immigration. This person hasn't done anything bad before."
1,"He should not be entering the us illegally but that is not a setious enough crime to warrent prison. I think that he should just pay abfine and be deported."
1,"Of course he should go to prison. He needs to be locked up until we can get him deported and make sure he stays deported. Why should we allow people who come into the country illegally and then commit a violent crime to do anything except go to prison and then be deported....again."
1,"This person should go to prison as a  deterrent for not getting back in our country. He should be sentenced to at least a year in prison, and when his sentence has been served he should be deported to his home country."
1,"He illegally entered the country. He broke the law.  He should go to prison and then be deported."
0,"In general people shouldn't be imprisoned for non violent behavior.  If a person works and pays taxes they should get a path to citizenship"
1,"I genuinely don't feel I have enough evidence on what the prison sentences were and what his reasoning was for entering the United States. They should take into account the prison sentences as well as why he was entering the US illegally and put him on trial based on those."
1,"We should report the person because they have committed a crime that they have ran away from. We should also send this person to prison to prevent any further future violent crimes here in the United States."
0,"I believe that prison should only be for violent crimes or the """"worst of the worst"""" non-violent offenses, like embezzlement of millions of dollars or major drug trafficking. Our prisons are already too crowded. If he's here illegally, then deporting him is enough punishment."
1,"In this situation, it is unclear if the person had served out his sentence in the foreign country for the previous crime.  If he has not been punished, then the U.S. government should put him in prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence.  He should not be placed in prison simply for being in the country illegally. "
1,"I think most offenders are likely to recommit their crimes. If the person was already in prison for a violent crime, they should not be allowed to be in our country illegally. If they came in through legal means, I think this might be a different situation."
0,"Its a small crime at the time. They should just be sent back"
1,"I don't think this person should be sent to prison. I think this person should be sent back to his or her country or fined. I think prison is too harsh of a sentence for someone who simply wants to live in a better place and have some opportunity. Everyone deserves that no matter what their past is like."
1,"He should go to prison because he has shown that he is not willing to follow the law and continues to enter the country illegally. He also has committed violent crimes and will probably continue to do so if he is deported."
1,"I don't think he should be allowed to remain in the country because of his past violent offense. Sending him to prison for an immigration crime is too severe."
1,"Given this prompt, I would prefer more detail in order to genuinely reason one way or another. As is, the history seems risky, however considering only the illegal entry can lead to different conclusions."
1,"I think he should be given a chance to see what he wants to do in the United States, if he commits another crime he should be deported and not welcomed back. I think everyone deserves at least a chance at an opportunity in life, a chance to change and better themselves."
1,"Deporting the person did not keep him from returning, so I would suggest a tough prison sentence.  This might help to deter other criminals from believing they'll have an easier time in the U.S. than in their home country."
1,"He is a violent criminal who has already been deported back to his home country.  He committed another crime by entering the United States illegally.  If he is turned over to immigration authorities and deported again, he may return to the United States.  The public will be safe from him if he is in prison."
0,"Send them back to their originating country. Let them stay and fine them."
0,"He was just trying to get a better life.  Besides, a starving person may enjoy 3 meals a day and thr security of a prison.  This could backfire."
0,"I believe that this person should be sent to prison, because coming here illegally is a crime. Without a green card or becoming a citizen, you should not be here in America. Also alot of them commit crimes and cause problems with other people. The U.S. Government should put them in prison or deport them back to their own country. I believe this is the moral thing to do with the illegals."
1,"Criminals should not be allowed into our country. We have enough American citizens that are criminals to deal with."
1,"First of all illegal entering in any country is crime. And he has a criminal background previous so he must be taught some good lesson in jail."
1,"He should be sent to jail because he is a repeat offender. One of his offenses was a violent crime. If his only crime was illegally entering I would not agree with jail."
0,"with no prior felonies  i feel a fine and return to his country of origin is good enough"
1,"He was already convicted of a violent crime and should not be let back in to this country. He should go to prison if he commits another violent crime. Entering the country isn't something violent so he should be deported and let the other country deal with him. But then he will probably try coming over again so a prison cell might be a better place. I just don't know for sure."
1,"To make a long story, short, he is a threat to society - which is the prime reason someone should go to jail. If he was a benefit to society in any way, he would have shown it by now."
1,"Instead of prison he should be immediately deported. Let him be somebody else's problem."
0,"While I do not think he should be imprisoned in the United states and be a drain on our resources I do think that he should be arrested by law enforcement and deported back to his country and not allowed to come back to the United States in any fashion either legally or illegally and if he is found here again then he should be put in prison."
0,"He didn't commit a horrible crime; he's just in the United States illegally. If he had committed murder or even stole something, then, yes, he should be sent to prison. However, since he has never gone to prison and never committed a crime that harmed anyone, he should be let go. Imprisoning him will just crowd up our already crowded prisons and waste taxpayer dollars. The US government should find a viable way for him to gain citizenship (such as entering a government program)."
1,"No, he served his time but, should be deported back to where he came from. He shouldn't come into the USA illegally."
1,"He committed crimes, and most importantly, violent crimes, so should be convicted on that.  I am not concerned as much with his immigration status, although the fact that he keeps returning after deportation should be taken into account.  I am not judging his origin, just his crimes."
1,"This person just entered the country illegally.  Kick him out.  Prison does not serve any benefit to society here."
0,"The prison system is overloaded anyway. His first offense, which is non-violent. Send him back and have his picture with border patrol."
1,"Because of his past criminal offenses. I think he should be put in jail then sent back."
1,"While I can usually overlook the entering the US """"illegally"""" part, unless there is some type of explanation for the violent crime in the past (i.e - rigged courts / he was being attacked, etc) it isn't the type of person who is likely to change much when here. The US government can either a) pay tax money incarcerating him here in the US or b) extradite him back to his home country, and he can serve his time there."
0,"The offender should have to prove hardship in the country he's from. The government should require this person to prove that he can provide value to the United States."
0,"I do not believe he should be imprisoned for a non violent offense. Instead I believe this person should be detained and sent back to their country of origin."
0,"He should be sent back to his home country. Since he did not commit any other crimes, he has no reason to be kept in a US prison."
1,"He did his sentance for the 2 crimes he commited. I think anyone should be able to come to the united states as long as they obey the rules."
1,"He is a repeat offender thus needs to be sent to prison. But since he's an illegal, he should be sent back to his country of origin. Either solution is suitable."
0,"I believe this person should be deported because this person entered the country illegally. This means that this person is not allowed to stay and should be sent back to their origin."
1,"This individual should be punished because he has entered our country illegally. In addition, he has previously been convicted of violent acts. It poses a risk to other citizens."
1,"If he illegally entered the country then he should be deported back to the country where he is a citizen. Having him serve jail time here will only put a burden on tax payers. Even if he were imprisoned here he would still be illegal so it doesn't solve any problem."
0,"He should be given a path to citizenship."
0,"Since the said offender has no prior criminal record, I don't see any valid reason here to send him to prison. Unless he's a spy, the government should look for other options to deal with this issue."
1,"The government should deport this person as soon as possible. He is a violent offender and has repeatedly broken our laws. Steps need to be taken in order for illegal immigration to stop, if it takes a wall we should build a wall."
0,"He should be process and deported. Prisons are for criminals."
0,"This person has committed a crime that is punishable by being deported to his country of origin.  That is what should happen."
1,"He is a criminal and committed a crime in our country."
1,"Previous sentence of a violent crime."
1,"He should be sent back to his home country, to serve time there for any crimes he's committed there or to be free if he's not wanted for arrest. The solution to illegal immigration isn't keeping people here and in prison, it's sending people back to their homes so that they can do it the right way."
0,"Depending on how long he has been here and what contributions he has made the the country, he should either be allowed to stay and issued the proper documentation, or be sent back to his country.  If he has established roots here and is a contributing member of our society I think he should be considered to allow to stay."
1,"He has previously served jail time and one was for a violent crime.  This is not a good person and he seems to be a danger to the rest of society."
0,"Illegal immigration alone is not a serious enough crime to warrant jail time. A fine seems more appropriate for the crime."
1,"This person should preferably be sent to prison in their home country- deported and then imprisoned there. But if they have already returned, then it would be better to imprison them for first the violent crime and then for the illegal stay/entry. "
1,"The man did not commit a crime except being in the country. Taxpayers should not pay for additional jailing for someone who will be deported eventually."
1,"The offender previously committed a violent crime and was deported. He was directed not to return to this country. People who are not citizens of this country and commit violent crimes here are the kinds of immigrants that we do not want here. The way to prevent them from coming here is by punishing them if they do. Therefore, for reasons of deterrence, the U.S. government should give them a prison sentence before deporting them again. Each time this person is caught here subsequently, the sentence is increased. "
0,"I think there should be a way that people can make it right if they haven't been in other trouble. I would like to see them learn the language and pass the citizenship tests that my mother had to pass to become a citizen. She came here legally."
0,"I do not think he needs to go to prison.  I think he should just be sent back to his home country and told if he wanted to come here, he should do it the correct way."
1,"Sending him to prison would not be an appropriate punishment for illegally entering the country. Sending him to prison should only be done if he was a threat to public safety, but he had done his time for the violent crime already. Sending him home would be preferable."
0,"He didn't do anything to harm anyone and for all we know he could be here looking for a job to better his life. Even though he did come illegally, he was no harm."
0,"He should not be prisoned but deported abck to his country. Ifyou imprison him you are wasting the tax money on him. He doesnot deserve to be in this country so he should be deported."
1,"This person should be deported again and imprisoned in his own country. That is in theory. Legally that is not possible. 

At the very least this illegal immigrant should be deported, yet again! There is not enough room in the federal budget to house illegal immigrants for crimes, violent or not. They need to be sent back as soon as possible to thier legal country of origin. "
1,"This person is a repeat offender. If I ruled the word, the words """"repeat offender"""" would be extricated from the lexicon and would be replaced by """"where did my no good relative that committed a crime disappear to?"""" People that commit crimes should be removed from society, whether that is hard labor camps or incarceration. We do not need these people destroying our beautiful world.The person described is violent and not a good person. They should disappear."
0,"Because everyone has a reason for leaving their country and it's not done lightly. If someone leaves without being imprisoned, it's probably because their life was so hard and they felt they had no choice. I don't think it's fair to imprison someone for doing something illegal that doesn't hurt anyone. People letting off fireworks illegally at 3am in the morning while under the influence of alcohol are far more likely to hurt someone. Do they go to prison? No."
0,"They should send him back to his country of origin. If he comes back again, I think that should be considered an offense."
0,"I really don't know how to judge the severity of this crime and what an appropriate punishment would be.  If someone were to sneek into a club, ball game, or onto private property in general they would probably be at least subject to trespassing charges but my guess is this would involve only a fine and not prison time.  However, this crime is probably more severe.  If someone were to sneek onto the grounds of the White House I think they would likely be charged with crimes that involve prison time however illegally entering the United States might be considered less sever than such a crime.  I guess I'd have to here arguments for and against before I could come to some sort of conclusion.  In general, I don't have a strong sense of the harms of the crime."
1,"This man had already illegally entered the country and committed a violent crime and deported.  He has now broken the law again by illegally entering this country a second time."
1,"although i dont think it will do any good, i think the man should be sent back to his home country. i do not want my tax payer money going towards keeping a non citizen in jail."
0,"I do not have enough information about the individual to say."
0,"Depending on his background it could be reasonable to deport him, but to imprison him is much too severe. If he has a family or children here or with him, then I would say don't deport him at all, but simply track him and ensure that he attains legal status with in X number of years. "
0,"He is here illegally and despite the fact that he violated the law.He must be in prisoned for several years in order for him to learn."
0,"He crossed the border ILLEGALLY. He is a criminal. We have laws in this country. There is a legal way to come."
0,"I believe as his punishment, he should deported back to the country where he is a citizen. I don't think the tax payers should support his stay in prison. He should be removed from the country."
0,"Entering any country illegally is wrong. He must face consequences for his wrong actions"
0,"First it should be determined why he illegally entered the country. Was it for work or to escape troubles in his own country. Or was it for criminal reasons.
Second, only after determining the man's reason for illegal entry should it then be decided if he deserves to be sent to prison and then actually is or is not."
1,"He entered illegaly he should be jailed. Since he has a violent pass he should be jailed."
0,"I don't think detaining him here on our soil quite fits the crime. I'm entirely against illegal immigration, no matter the reason, but I think the punishment for illegally entering the country for a first time offender should be deportation (at their expense, if possible) and a ban from returning. If he were a repeat offender, who attempted or snuck back in after being told to leave and stay out, then I could see stepping up the punishment to imprisonment."
1,"The  person has a record of multiple violent offences and is therefore a repeat offender.  It would be justified for he U.S. government to once again jail and than deport this person."
0,"He should be deported. Why should we pay to house him in our prison system?"
1,"Yes, he has prior sentences to prison for one. For two, he was already deported and decided to sneak back into the US of A. He should either be deported again or sent to prison."
0,"They broke the law. That is al."
1,"It depends on if the man committed a crime other than entering the country. Our prisons are already over crowded, if he just entered illegally then he should be deported and warmed if he is caught entering again he would be sent to prison."
0,"He committed a crime by coming into the country illegally. Others do it the proper way and we do it the proper way when we visit other countries so if a person can not come into the country the legal way and they are caught then yes they should be sentenced to jail time for the offense."
0,"While I think that all immigrants should follow the rules to get here they simply cannot arrest him when so many others do it. I think he should be held somewhere and made to immigrate legally. Maybe he could be used in a working position to patrol the border. It employs him and shows he can be a benefit as well as allows him to legally be a citizen."
0,"He should not be punished. Because he is not committed any such mistakes in the past. Unfortunately this is the first time he has committed such mistake. So he can not be punished."
0,"Due to the fact that he has no record and the fact that imprisoning this man will cause financial burden on him and the US, I think that the US should not give this man a prison sentence. The US should extradite this man to his home country and let them decide how or if he should be punished. "
1,"I think he should because, one, he is a repeat offender of entering the country illegally.  Also, two, he is a violent offender as well."
0,"Simply setting foot illegally in the United States is not grounds for imprisonment. What the government should do is house them at the local embassy for his country. Then interview him as to why he did not choose to explore the options available prior to illegally setting foot into the United States as opposed to do it the right way."
0,"I do not believe that illegally entering the United States should be a crime punishable with prison sentences. Our prison system is terrible and should be reserved for true criminals. If you want to control the flow of illegal immigration then send them back to the countries from which they came."
1,"I think that he should serve a medium or short sentence, maybe 30 days. This should be thought of as a deterrent to entering the US illegally. Then he should be deported."
0,"He should be deported. It's not necessary to criminalize behavior that has no direct victim."
0,"If the person has a job and never committed any crimes, they shouldn't be sent back. We need hard working people in America."
0,"The man did not hurt anyone and should be sent back to their country. If people who don't like illegals don't want them coming in and 'stealing' our money, why let tax money to funding them in prison?"
1,"He should be sent to prison, then the US government should deport him back to his home country. This may deter him from illegally entering the country again."
1,"He should go back to prison because he commited a violent crime. He should stay more than 2 years in prison."
1,"THE PERSON  CAN BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN US"
0,"I don't think the man should be sentenced to jail because he didn't do anything wrong. I think that they should do tests and interrogate him though."
1,"I don't think entering the country illegally should be grounds for jail time. If they feel he should serve any kind of punishment, they should send him back to his own country, and advise that he has broken the law in a foreign country. Maybe it will have repercussions on his life in his home country. But there is no reason we should keep concerning ourselves with this person."
1,"I feel given the past of the individual and being that he is a repeat offender, the government should certainly deport this person back to his home country and then he should be tried and should be sent to prison if he is indeed found to be guilty. I don not feel that the US government has the right to trial, however, given the person is not a citizen."
1,"I think he should be deported, but not put into prison. His current crime is non-violent and has nothing to do with his previous crimes. We cannot continue to punish people for previous crimes after they have paid their debt to society."
1,"Which prison are we talking about? I don't want them in one in the US, but I would be fine with them going to prison again in the country that they came from. They should be sent back. That's my opinion."
0,"They should be sent to INS to be interviewed and determine why they came here."
1,"he was already involving crime. so that person never enters the united states. if he enters into them he should be go to prison."
0,"I feel he should not serve time in prison as this is his only crime. I feel deporting him to his home country would be more appropriate"
1,"What if he is reformed from this crime. Illegally entering the country doesn't seem like the type of crime that should earn such a harsh punishment."
0,"He seems like an outstanding citizen in his country. If this person did not commit any crime however he should probably need to be deported. He needs to follow to law like everyone else."
0,"Because as it is the first time that made a mistake of that degree it should not be so punished"
1,"He came here illegally in the first place, that means he doesn't respect our law regarding immigration. We are not against immigrant, were against people coming here illegally. Not only that he's been in prison for a violent crime and been deported. He should be send back to his country and put in prison. IF his country won't accept him then cut the aid for that country so they'll start taking their bad people.  "
0,"He shouldn't do time because it is not that serious. He has never committed another crime so they need to be lenient."
1,"I really think this person needs more compassion. Prison will not help him and will cost more money."
0,"The US government should send this man back to his country or fine him, or give him community service. Imprisonment is expensive and just exposes him to hardened criminals."
0,"He broke the law and there are penalties for committing a crime.  He needs to return or be sent back."
0,"If no prior crimes have been committed he should not be in prison. Deportation will be more appropriate"
1,"I don't think putting him back in jail would be a deterrent for him.  He has already been in jail twice and deported once, but he still came back into the country.  He should be deported again. While that may not keep him from trying to enter illegally again, he shouldn't be allowed to stay, unless there were extenuating circumstances (such as a short-term visit a dying relative, etc.)."
1,"Not only is this dude illegal, butt he's also a convicted criminal. This only gives more reason for him to be imprisoned. He should go to prison."
0,"Entering a country should not be a crime. I strongly feel that we should have open borders.  The government should instead of punishing such people provide a path to citizenship if that is what such a person wants.  And if the person is not seeking same, the government should still treat them right and let them in."
1,"He had already been deported once, and one of the sentences was for a violent crime. He should be deported again and have to pay a fine."
1,"This person has a history of being violent and it is clear that he is no ordinary person from that past. He should be imprisoned and deported as he refuses to follow legal immigration paths and his history is a poor indicator of his ability to be a successful resident."
0,"It depends on the situation. If this person is trying to enter the United States because of a catastrophic issue in their country (famine, genocide, etc.) then they have a legitimate reason to try to flee their homeland. However, if they do not have an extreme situation similar to the ones that I have listed then yes, they should be imprisoned."
1,"I think everyone should get a second chance no matter who they are"
0,"It's absurd. The penalty for being in the country illegally should not be to force him to stay. Ridiculous. I don't even think he should be deported."
1,"HE IS A CRIMINAL AND THEREFORE SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR SUCH REASON THAT DEPENDS ON THE AUTHORITIES THAT JUDGE IT OR NOT"
1,"I believe that he should not be sentenced to a term in a US prison.  I believe he should be deported.  Housing a prisoner is very expensive, and the US should not have to bear this cost."
1,"He should be sent back to his country and banned from entering the US or any of its territories."
0,"Because I don't think that's a crime that should be punishable by imprisonment.  It sounds like he has not had any other offenses; I see no reason to imprison him for this one."
0,"they should help with his citizenship process. As we should be a free country"
0,"I don't think he should be put in prison since he is just like any other illegal immigrant who is just looking for a better life.  He should probably be sent back to his home country and the authorities there will have a better idea of how he should be punished."
0,"I do not know enough about this man to know whether or not he should be imprisoned. Was he found entering the United States with illegal drugs or contraband, or was he entering the United States for instance because he feared for his life in his home country? In almost all cases I do not believe this individual should be sent to prison just for entering the country illegally. "
0,"I believe anyone who commits a crime should serve time in prison. Without consequences crime would run rampant."
1,"I don't want to pay for this person to be in prison.  Sending him to prison won't change his behavior.  I think he should be deported to his country of origin and let them deal with it."
0,"I dont think that we should make him a taxpayer burden. In this, he should be sent back to the country he came from"
0,"If the person has done nothing to cause prior entry in jail, I don't see a problem that is large enough to focus on him over murderers or rapists. He just wants to better himself, maybe his family, and doesn't belong in prison because of that. There are far more serious issues to focus on. "
0,""
1,"I think that he should be deported again. It's costly to house prisoners that are citizens of the United States. We should not have to do it for people who are not citizens."
0,"He should not be sent to prison as he is not a criminal. He didn't hurt anyone. Contrary to what popular conservative opinion is at the moment the simple existence of an immigrant causes no one and nothing any harm. The US government can deport him. He can go home to is own country and move on with his life. Although I do not have anything against immigrants and do not want them harmed, I still think that the uncontrolled immigration into the country needs to stop. "
1,"It's hard to say weather he should be sent to prison or deported. If the crime is serious enough, I would give him both choice, deportation and prison."
1,"He should be deported. We should waste money and space in our prisons for someone that is not a from the U.S."
1,"If the person is convicted of a crime that has a prison sentence attached to it, and has previously been convicted of a violent offense, I don't see why a prison sentence should be out of the question."
1,"Hr obviously has no authority for the law. He's already gotten deported to his home country for a violent crime, and had been in prison another time as well."
1,"I feel like his previous convictions were from the past, so it wouldn't be fair to put him in prison for entering the U.S. illegally. The U.S should allow him into a program that gives him a fair chance to apply for citizenship and gain employment with housing."
0,"This young broke the law with his actions by violating the policy requirements for entering the country. The government should sentence him to prison and required to complete the necessary steps for legal immigration."
1,"His current crime is illegally entering the U.S. for which he should be deported."
1,"Frankly, if people are going to live in this country, they should abide by the moral and ethical laws.  If this person can't do that, he should be imprisoned so he can't illegally re-enter the country. "
0,"He had no previous record at all.  This is a severe punishment."
1,"I'm torn between the man spending time in prison here and then being deported, or immediately being deported. His prison time here would be paid for by taxpayers, and is unlikely to stop him from committing another crime in the future. However, he did commit a crime and should be punished accordingly."
0,"He should just be deported with a warning at the very least. He didnt do anything harmful that should warrant a prison sentence."
0,"If he has committed a crime in the USA then he must go to an american prison and then deported. That is the law!"
0,"I think he should be deported for this conviction. I think imprisonment is too harsh for this crime, especially considering that he has never been imprisoned before. "
1,"He is here illegally, he has committed multiple crimes. "
0,"Illegally entering another country is a serious crime and such people should be sent to prison so that others don't follow the same path."
0,"He entered the country illegally.  Since this is a big current issue, we have to be strict. "
0,"Send him back to his country.  He has no criminal record."
0,"The prisons are full of non-violent offenders. It costs too much money to keep these people in, and in addition, prison should be for rehabilitation, not punishment."
1,"Yes because he had served two previous prison sentences. He should pay for those actions."
0,"No,  I think he should be sent back to the original Country that he came from.  I think why should we pay tax dollars etc to jail him when he shouldn't even be here. "
1,"First off he is not suppose to be in this country. Second, violent crime !!"
1,"Well, first of all he is not a U.S. citizen, or even the citizen of any U.S. district, State, or territory (including Washington, D.C.). Second of all, he no longer has Jeffersonian-Westphalian rights, because he is no longer in the United States. Therefore, there are at least two good reasons that the United States government of right out to, should, and would do nothing at all."
1,"cause he's a violent criminal and should not be allowed to stay"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison because he hasn't violated laws that warrant imprisonment in the United States. He is here illegally, so he should be sent to be deported or possibly to a detention center as he awaits a hearing that will determine his eligibility to stay in the US."
1,"I would like to know more about the previous crimes, but it was mentioned that one was violent.  It seems that he has served time for those crimes already.  It seems that he should definitely be deported again, but i am not sure if he should go to jail again."
0,"I don't feel that the offender should be sent to a prison in the US - it's an unnecessary drain on our resources and our prisons are already overcrowded.  Although he did commit a crime by entering illegally, the punishment should simply be that he is deported back to his country of origin."
1,"The criminal should be detained and deported as soon as possible. His prior convictions are not important."
0,"Because I think there are better things to do with our law enforcement resources. For instance, focusing on those who are violent offenders. Also, if this guys here because he wants a better life. Can I really blame him? I don't know him. For all I know he could be a really good person."
1,"I feel that if they break a law here, such as illegally entering the country, they should be charged with the crime, and go to prison. There is no reason we should not enforce our law, just as any other country would. If I illegally go to Mexico or Canada, they will take me to prison, so when someone comes here they go to prison, too. "
0,"I do not believe he should be sent to jail, as it would force American taxpayers to support him. He should be deported."
0,"Penalized in some way, perhaps.  Fined, maybe.  Warehoused in some for-profit prison, where the tax payers are supporting his institutionalization - no way. "
0,"If anything they should just be sent back to there come country. There no reason to stress the US prison system and cost tax payers more money."
0,"Yes, while waiting for deportation.  It should be no longer than seven days. Deport him to his country."
0,"if we are going to deter illegal immigration we should strictly enforce the law and apply harsh penalties for violations."
0,"It costs taxpayer money to keep someone in prison.  Since it's an immigrant who did not actually commit any violent crime, there is no way to rehabilitate them."
1,"This offender should definitely be sent to prison. Not only is he not paying taxes like all other law-abiding citizens, but he has also proved himself to be a criminal. Further, he is not just any criminal, he has committed and served time for violent crime."
0,"It is illegal to enter a country. If it's illegal, he should be punished. I think that he should at least pay a fine and have to take steps to become a legal alien. "
0,"No one got hurt and no dangerous crime was committed. He should only be given a warning,"
1,"I think the person should be imprisoned or sent back to their home country. While I do believe we should be more open with our immigration policy, we need to be more strict with immigrants who have criminal backgrounds. We don't have to accept people who pose a risk to our safety."
1,"Political compromise is difficult in American democracy even though no one doubts it is necessary. It is difficult for many reasons, including the recent increase in political polarization that has been widely criticized. We argue that the resistance to compromise cannot be fully appreciated without understanding its source in the democratic process itself, especially as conducted in the U.S. The incursion of campaigning into governing in American democracy--the so called """"permanent campaign""""--encourages political attitudes and arguments that make compromise more difficult. These constitute what we call the uncompromising mindset, characterized by politicians' standing on principle and mistrusting opponents. This mindset is conducive to campaigning, but not to governing, because it stands in the way of necessary change and thereby biases the democratic process in favor of the status quo. The uncompromising mindset can be kept in check by an opposite cluster of attitudes and arguments--the compromising mindset--that inclines politicians to adapt their principles and respect their opponents. This mindset is more appropriate for governing, because it enables politicians more readily to recognize and act on opportunities for desirable compromise. We explore the dynamics of these mindsets by examining the processes that led to the compromises on tax reform in 1986 and health care reform in 2010."
1,"Should not go to jail because it is not a crime of such magnitid, as to be, and referring to the previous crimes should not influence, since already paid with jail said crimes, and can not be imputed or tried a person for crimes that They would have already paid."
1,"He is a repeat offender and apparently is unable to stop committing crimes. He'll likely again try to enter the US if simply deported and may not be caught next time. This would leave yet another violent criminal loose--he's caught, keep him that way."
1,"In the grand entered the country and is known as a violence person which has served to citizen decisions were made according to the court of law. He has tagged himself as being a menace to society. I do feel that this man cannot be trusted among the innocent people in this country and that he should be deported back to his native country."
1,"I think that the offender should not be sent to prison, he should only be deported back to his home country. Just because he had previous time in prison doesn't necessarily mean that he is still a criminal, however he should legally obtain citizenship in order to stay or he should be deported."
0,"Because it makes more sense to me to deport him.  Why should we have to pay for him to be imprisoned."
0,"The only people with any dibs on America are Native Americans.  We all had family land here so it makes no difference to me if your blood line arrived 200 years ago or two months ago.  This person broke no rule or crime that I think is legit."
0,"I would send the man back to his original country. I do not think jail time here would fit this type of crime."
1,"He already has a history of violence and had been deported. He acted threateningly by returning illegally. I think he should serve time in prison and then be deported again."
1,"This man needs to go to prison because he has a history of violent crime.Then he needs to be deported back to his country."
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison. I think he should be deported immediately."
1,"The subject sounds like a lifetime offender. I believe that the US should deport him back to his county of origin."
0,"Because we have enough people locked up already. Also it's ridiculous that we car so much about immigration, legal or illegal."
1,"I say if he is illegal than again send him back to his own country. Seems like he can't stay out of trouble so he should be in jail but why cost us money when he isn't even a citizen? Send him back."
1,"The person should be in prison because he broke the immigration rules of the United States, he was deported and he entered in an illegal way again. If he was deported is because it was a threat to the country, and a person with the status of this man should take care about their actions, so he should be  for a short time and then deported."
1,"This man needs to be immediately deported, he should be sent to prison, but not in the United States.  He has already done time for being a violent offender, and it is just a matter of time until he really hurts someone.  But, it is not our problem, that is probally want he wants to stay here and let us take care of him."
0,"The us is based on immagration and many of the people here should be allowed to stay if they have no criminal record. They do many of the jobs that we don't want to."
1,"He broke the law and illegally entered the country. He also has a criminal history"
1,"If the charge is just entering the USA illegally, he should be deported again to his home country. If there are other criminal charges involved, he could go to jail here to do his time, and then be deported again."
0,"I think we have enough people in our prisons already. If you really want to punish someone for entering the US illegally, deport them. "
0,"This person did break the law and he does have to face consequences such as facing deportation.  He does not belong in prison since he did not have any prior criminal record."
0,""
1,"The man has clearly offended more than once. At this point, there is more than just what is shown at the surface. I think he should be rehabilitated."
1,"He is not a US Citizen.  He should be sent back to his home country after fulfilling  his punishment for his US offensive"
0,"The person should be given one more chance. The person should be fined a small sum of money and warned not to do the same act again."
0,"should kick him out of the country."
1,"This man violates the crime and need to be penalized by being sent to prison. This is how the justice system should  work."
1,"Since he was caught entering the United States illegally, I wouldn't imprison him in the US. I think the right decision would be to have him sent back to his home country to have his sentence carried out there. As for the trial, I don't think that should be carried out in the US either. The cost of the trial and the location should be in the home country as well."
1,"He should be jailed because he illegally entered the country, which means he has broken the law. If someone intentionally breaks the law, he is a criminal."
0,"He is a human being presumably looking for a better life, why should this individual be locked in a cage? "
1,"What is the point of using resources to keep this man in prison?"
0,"This type of behavior should be deterred. He should be sent back to his country. Imprisoning him here is a further drain on government money. Now, if he is caught here illegally again, then punitive action should be taken."
1,"Due to the immagrant convicted of a violent crime, and resulting in deportation, the process of re-entering the country is illegal. Being a illegal immigrant is risky, however being deported from our country results in a basic ban on entering the country. Due to this, the result should be a prison sentence."
1,"He has a prior violent crime violation. He also entered the country illegally and therefore should be punished."
0,"He should be deported but not imprisoned. He didn't do any wrong but needs to leave because we can't house the world."
1,"He should be deported and his country will deal with him"
1,"Normally I'm fine with illegal immigration, but the possibility of a repeat violent offense means I would be willing to support his incarceration. I would also consider deportation, depending on familial situations. "
0,"He should be sent to prison so he can be detained and then deported to his country. The government should deport him and not allow him a VISA since he illegally entered."
0,"If he was caught immediately after entering, I would say it would be fair to immediately send him back to wherever he came from (unless he was legitimately seeking asylum) - there's no reason to allow him to *stay*, but there's no reason to spend *our* money punitively keeping him in prison, either. He didn't harm anyone, and we've got better things, as a country, to do with our time and our money than ruining peoples' lives for trying to enter the US&gt; "
1," If he is guilty of violent crimes , we should just send him back rather than housing him here"
0,"And then after the prison sentence, the man should be deported.  Illegally entering the US is a serious violation of our safety.  Just because you don't have a criminal record doesn't mean you should be let off the hook.  If people found out that they wouldn't be punished for trying to sneak across the border, many more people would try it because they'd have nothing to lose."
1,"This person should be sent to prison for his apparent lack of understanding of immigration law. He has already entered the country illegally once before and was punished for it, and returned to attempt it again. "
1,"This person needs to be dealt with in some way but I wonder if he could be deported to be sentenced or handled in his country. Our prisons in the US are already full and imprisoning illegals is an expense for our country."
0,"They have no prior criminal offenses. They aren't going to be a threat to the public. We don't have room to imprison people for reasons like this."
0,"He should be sent back to the country he came from and apply to enter the country legally."
1,"This person has been a repeat offender. He has already been deported and illegally entered the country again."
0,"This person should be deported immediately and not allowed to enter the US again. He should also not be allowed to ever become a green card holder, resident or citizen because of his crime. If he is caught a second time then he should be imprisoned. I just don't think we are capable financially or logistically of imprisoning and caring fro thousands of illegal immigrants though they have committed a crime I take very seriously."
1,"I don't think someone should be sent to prison just for illegally entering the country. He should serve time for whatever violent offense he had been charged with."
1,"While I have a somewhat lenient view towards immigration that only comes into play when the immigrant is trying to make a better life for them self or family. This guy has committed at least one violent offense, on top of one other unknown charge, and this is his third strike. Jail one hundred percent. "
0,"I do not think a person should go to prison for entering our country illegally, if they do not have any prior criminal offenses. They are just trying to create a better life for themselves. Why should one infraction, and one which he didn't harm anyone, land him in prison."
0,"The person should be deported for illegally entering the Country, but not put into prison. Unless the person here illegally commits a violent crime, they shouldn't go to prison."
1,"He should go back to prison because he is study breaking them all and not trying to do better I believe in three strikes you're out."
0,"He should not be sent to prison because he harmed no one and did not harm any property. The U.S. government should ask why he entered illegally and take action based on his reasoning (i.e. He was looking for a better life so the government helps him get citizenship and allows him to live here in the meantime)."
1,"This man should be incarcerated because he committed a crime. He should also be incarcerated because he has a criminal record."
1,"It depends on the crime he committed."
0,"The U.S. government should not do anything to man. At the very most if the government is to take action they should deport this individual."
1,"He should get jail time. He should then be deported."
0,"He has committed no wrongdoing and should not be sent to prison. He should simply be sent back to his country of origin or given the opportunity to naturalize."
1,"Of course he should go to prison. That's what would happen anywhere else, and there's no reason it shouldn't happen in the U.S. Then, the offender should be deported."
0,"First of all it will cost us money. Second being in prison is not a fair punishment for wanting to join our country. Just return him to his country."
1,"I feel like he should have to undergo some kind of prison sentence. The reason being, he's already illegally entered this country before if he was deported before. Since he's not only repeatedly entered the country, but committed violent crimes, he can't just be let off free. I think if he had a criminal record, but it was non-violent, then I could see just deporting him, but the violence is what makes me think this is someone who probably needs to face some kind of jail sentence."
1,"This person should be deported. It is too expensive to put him back in prison.  He will just get out in less than a year anyway."
0,"The US should not spend money to imprison a citizen of another nation. This person should be sent back to their home country."
0,"I don't feel like prison is the answer in this case. It would just burden the prison system. A better option is to return them to their country of origin."
0,"Because the prisons are already filled up enough as it is. Plus, he has never been imprisoned before."
1,"Yeah, he is dangerous person to the united states and with him breaking a law by entering the country illegally he deserves to be punished. Otherwise, it will only encourage others with similar backgrounds to do the same. "
0,"This person should not be sent to prison because they are non violent offender.  I believe the government should give this person the tools to become a citizen legally.  They could then contribute to the nation, instead of draining it. "
0,"This person should not be sent to prison because he has no criminal past.  Odds are he was coming here for a better life.  The U.S. government should either send him back to his country or show him the way to citizenship.  There is a reason he came to the U.S. and instead of criminalizing his action the government should help."
0,"The U.S. government should deport this man back to his home country with a warning. If the man attempts to come into the country illegally ever again, then he should be sent to prison. He should also be barred from entering the U.S. legally (visa, etc.) for a short period (maybe 5 years). These actions need to be taken to secure our border and to stop the flow of unneeded and unwanted immigration."
1,"I think if he's a repeat offender then he should serve time just like any regular US citizen. It's one thing if he's contributing to society, but if he's here just to cause trouble, then we don't need him out in society. It really doesn't even matter if he's an illegal immigrant or not to me. He's served multiple prison sentences and it doesn't seem like he's learned anything from it."
1,"He's crossing the border illegally.  He already is a criminal.  He's had his chance so the US needs to put him in prison because he is a repeat offender."
1,"Remove the offender to his country of origin. It costs too much to keep him in prison not to mention the expense of a trial."
1,"He served the prison breaks for the previous crimes. Hence he cannot be sent to prison again. He might be deported back to his home country, has he was entering illegally."
0,"He should be deported but not imprisoned."
1,"He should be sentenced and deported back to his country. But since he won't be held accountable in his country, ie., won't serve time there, he should serve time in the US and upon the completion of his sentence deported back to his country. And while he's serving his time here, he should work to contribute to the cost of his incarceration. "
1,"Well he should be sent back to his home and dealt with there. I dont want wasting resources on people like that."
0,"The man should not be convicted. Really what crime did he commit jcame in illigally. That just seems unfair we should find out why he is here and idf good reason or in tentions help him stay legally."
0,"I'd like to know the extenuating circumstances. Our immigration system is broken so it would not be my first choice to just send someone away to prison versus deportation or other legal remedies as indicated. We imprison too many people as it is."
1,"He should be sent back to his own country. Our prisons are already overcrowded."
0,"Either deport or let him go. Keeping him in prison is foolish because it'll do nothing but cost the tax payers money and possibly turn him into a real criminal by exposing him to prison life."
0,"He hasn't really committed a crime in a global world without borders he was just trying to build a better life. prisons are for keeping the public safe, he represents no harm to the public. "
0,"He broke a law. If you break a law, you go to prison."
1,"The government should deport him because he is here illegally. I also feel like he is probably a danger to society since he has served time in prison. That is another reason he should be deported."
1,"No, I think they should let his home country deal with him and follow through with the deportation procedure. He has already been in jail so I'm not sure that is gonna help."
0,"THE PERSON CAN BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY."
1,"Because he has prior offenses, the most important being a conviction for a violent offense."
1,"He came here illegally. He had already once been deported back to his home country. He was imprisoned twice - one for a violent crime. He belongs in jail, not back where he can try again."
0,"This person should not be sent to prison because they have not commited a crime besides entering the country illegally. They are not a danger to society and going to prison would not make them a better person."
1,"The person should be deported rather than sent to prison. There would seem no reason to keep the person in jail. the person should be tried by the laws of the country."
0,"I don't have enough information to make a decision. The person has never been imprisoned, but that doesn't mean the person has never committed a crime."
1,"He has broken the law. He has shown he will continue to break the law."
0,"It depends on why he's here. If a corporation or company or contractor lured him here with the promise of money for doing labor, then no.  If there is jail time for this sort of thing, then 1-3 days. Detention until they can be deported, or fine and they do whatever paperwork they need to do to enter the country legally.  "
0,"It is wrong that this man tried to enter the country illegally but he doesn't seem to have violated any other laws.  I think it is most appropriate if we send him back to his own country."
1,"I believe he should be held in an immigration center or jail facility until such time as he can be deported back to his home country. I do not think a prison sentence would be appropriate in this instance. However, there should be something in place to ensure that if the man re-enters the US illegally he would be subject to the fullest penalty the law allows."
0,"This person hasn't committed a crime before so there can be some assumption this illegal act is one of desperation, and perhaps with the right opportunity they won't offend again. Equally, there is no merit in this person becoming a burden on the US economy through the expense of prison and trial. They shluld just be deported home unless they have a good case for asylum. "
1,"I don't think he should be punished just for entering the country. I don't know the circumstances for which he is trying to live in this country, and he might have a very good reason for trying to do so. He served his time for past offenses and I feel he should be given a second chance as American citizens would be able to do so."
0,"I think he should have went through the proper steps but sometimes it's not an option. We are all immigrants in The United States we were not here first what right do we have to kick someone out!!!"
0,"I think the punishment for this crime should be to send the man back to his country if there must be punishment at all.  It would be silly for the U.S to put him in prison and have tax payers support the cost.  The man has done nothing wrong in the past and just made the mistake of coming here and getting caught.  It's not the grand deal that our country makes it out to be."
1,"Only if he's committed another crime. There are millions of people living very responsibly in this country who are here illegally. There's no reason to imprison them unless they've broken one of our laws - aside from the illegal immigration one!"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison in the USA.  He should be deported back to his country where they can decided to put him back in prison.  I would then change my answer to yes.  I would send him to prison in his country.  Not the USA where we are feeding, housing, caring, and providing medical for him."
0,"since this person seems to not have a record they should be given a chance to be here. at the very least they should just be sent back home. prison will solve nothing."
0,"Because imprisonment is not a good way to solve the immigration problem. Throwing people in jail will only anger and upset them, and waste taxpayer' money. We should have a vetting system and let the good people stay, deport those bad ones to ensure our country is safe."
0,"Yes, he apparently committed a crime by entering the US illegally but he hurt no one and shouldn't be sent to prison for this. He should be deported to his home country if safe to do so, otherwise he can apply for asylum."
0,"I think he should be deported. Why would we put stress on our already stressed prison system to accommodate a member of another country."
1,"He should be deported. He has a violent past and no real right to stay here. We shouldn't just throw him in jail or prison, we'd have to pay for that and he doesn't deserve that either. Send him back and i'd be fine with that."
1,"He already has a history of violence and time in jail. If he is let loose, he will do something that might hurt innocents."
1,""
1,"He has no regard for the laws of this country, he will commit a crime, and the government will be to blame."
1,"It's not because he is an illegal alien so much as that he has already been convicted of a violent crime and made to leave. The fact that he is sneaking back in again shows me that he has very little regard for the law in general and is likely to commit another violent crime"
1,"If this person had not been deported before, I would not say he should go to prison.  However, since he has a history of violence AND has already been deported once, clearly deportation is not a deterrent for staying out of the US."
0,"You should go through legal means to enter this country. Yes, he should have to go prison, or to a lesser extent, jail. "
1,"Yes, the U.S. government should send him to prison for the fullest term possible. Deporting him isn't going to solve the problem, mainly because he will just come back into the country again. Attempting to work out a deal with his country so he serves a prison sentence there more than likely wouldn't be the best thing either, depending on which country he is from. "
0,"This person does not deserve prison time. This person should simply be sent back to their country of origin."
0,"He shouldn't be sent to prison but he should be sent back to his country and should never be allowed to return."
0,"I do not think that this offense warrants a prison sentence. Each year a person is in prison costs a tax payer 50,000-60,000 dollars which is outrageous in itself. We don't need more burden on the people."
0,"Just deport him. He came here illegally, so he should be sent back to his home country."
1,"He is obviously a repeat offender. He has no respect for the law"
0,"America offers equality and a chance to start over for all. If someone comes here in search of the American Dream, they should be given a shot at achieving it. The ONLY exception to this should be if they are a danger to American citizens. There has to be something bad going on in their nation that they risked coming to a new country illegally. That should be given consideration,"
1,"The person should be sentenced to prison for the crime that he committed and then when he is let out of prison he should be deported again."
1,"yes he should. i think he knows what he is doing and just does not care"
0,"Did he do anything else wrong ? We are a country of immigrants, none of us would be here without immigration. Leave the people alone, they are just looking for a better life "
0,"he should be deported. we shouldn't waste money feeding him."
0,"The man probably had a good reason for coming to the U.S. He didn't do anything to harm or endanger anyone else. It would be a waste of money to keep him in prison."
1,"I think that since he is a felon (violent crime) and has already been deported once, he should be sent to prison for a year and then deported upon his release."
0,"No need - no record, non-violent. Just deport him."
1,"This is a repeat offender so I would put him in prison for sure. My first choice though would be to deport him back to his own country and let them deal with it. He is not worth wasting resources in a US prison."
0,"He should be punished for entering illegally. but not just because they are """"some"""" other country. And we should think about their families too. If they already living in country for years without doing any harm to the country, I don't think there is any reason to punish them."
1,"I think this person has a criminal record and has already been deported from the country once and returned illegally which leads me to believe that he may try to return again illegally in the future if let go without punishment. I think he should go to prison pending a trial into his immigration status and then deported again after his term is finished."
0,"He should be sent back to his home country. If we put him in prison, then he will be the financial responsibility of US tax payers, which is not much different if he wasn't in prison. "
0,"because he did crime and illeagel should be in prison for 3 to 3 month"
0,""
0,"I don't think tax payer dollars should be used to house illegal immigrants.  That burden should be placed on the country of origin.  I do believe we should be deporting people back to the country that they tried to enter illegally from.  The only exception I would make would be if there was terrorist motives for the reason they entered the country, then they should be arrested."
1,"I believe it would be in the best interest of everyone involved to to deport this person back to the home. There is no reason to incur the expense of incarcerating this person,"
0,"The US should imprison him for a minimum of 1 year and maximum of 5 years. This person illegally snuck into the country. Once the end of imprisonment, the person should be sent back to their original country."
1,"Shown o a threat to society"
1,"He committed a violent crime in the U.S. and returned after he'd been (I assume) banished."
1,"This person has proven time and time again to be a danger. As a noncitizen with a history of entering illegally and of committing crimes, it would be completely within the obligations of the government to punish the perpetrator."
1,"I think if he had illegally entered our country, then he is wrong to begin with. And on top of that he was accused of two crimes and deported back to his country and should serve time for those crimes.."
1,"The first thing he has no respect for our country or its laws by coming here illegally.  Second since he has been deported twice already and imprisoned twice as well means that if he doesn't go to prison he will be in the general public with no regard for our laws and likely to committ mayhem."
1,"He should be deported back to his country. If he were to commit another violent crime, I'd say he should go to prison here for that crime. "
0,"He shouldn't be imprisoned. He didn't do anything to harm anyone. He should be deported back to his country. If he's imprisoned here we will be spending our money on him in our country."
0,"It would not be good to spend tax dollars holding him. I think the most humane thing to do is send him back home."
0,"Incarcerating him would cost U.S. taxpayers more money than extraditing him.  The U.S. government should send him back to his country and work out a way to receive compensation with his home country."
0,"The man has broken the law but I do not believe this is a crime worth of imprisonment. Beyond that I believe the government should put him through whatever the process is that someone would enter the country legally (I am not familiar with what that is). If for some reason it is not feasible for him to become a citizen, the U.S. government should evaluate whether his home country is safe and if it is deny him access to the US."
1,"I could not decide. I see points from btoh angles."
1,"He should be deported. We can not continue to harbor criminals at our own expense."
0,"This is a minor infraction in my opinion.  The man should not be allowed to stay in the United States, but should be immediately deported back to his home country and threatened with jail time and a fine if he is caught again."
1,"I'm not sure what the legal consequences for illegally entering are. If the consequences for such an offense are jail time, then he should go to jail. If the consequences are deportation, he should be deported. He should be punished according to the law. "
0,"i feel as if that is too harsh. he should just be deported back and if anything a small fine."
0,"If this person do this type of action first time. I hope U.S. government should tell him this is illegally way to entering the United States. Again If you do this type of actions. We punish you."
1,"This person should absolutely be sent back to prison because he is a repeat offender. This person should be sentenced to the maximum prison term allowed by law."
0,"This person has committed a crime by breaking the law, so prison (or an equivalent) should be among the first stops along the way to deportation. Before going to prison, however, the US government should clarify whether the person might be considered a refugee, and that the prison involved is not filled with the same people he was running from. If it is clear that he is a refugee, then the government should identify a local charitable group or one of the refugee resettlement organizations who would then take over the care of that individual. Refugees should become citizens as quickly as possible, unless they desire to eventually return home. Immigrants who arrive illegally should be banned from citizenship and deported."
1,"They should put him in prison for doing something illegal. They then should deport him back to his country."
0,"This person should be reported to his own country."
1,"This person should not be sent to prison. They should be deported back to their home country. The crime of entering the country illegally deserves the consequence of being returned to the home country. A prison sentence doesn't make sense."
1,"Because of his previous prison sentences (in the U.S.?) he shouldn't be allowed to stay in the U.S. He should be deported. I don't think we should be imprisoning people for illegally entering the U.S. as it doesn't make sense to me to pay for prisons just for people who try to get into the U.S. I think that problems with illegal entry, the border, and deportation don't justify building prisons to try to solve those problems."
0,"I believe he should be sent back to his country of origin, immediately. I do not think we should pay for him to be in prison if he has committed no other crimes, but he must leave. I think he could be given a warning if he comes back again illegally he may do some jail time and then be deported again. I would encourage him to get in line and try to come in the proper way. I do believe if he is returned home this should not be held against him if he would like to apply to come here legally."
0,"He did commit a crime by illegally entering the United States but he wasn't violent  or have a criminal background. He should just get deported with no jail time. Why should he go to jail with violent offenders when he isn't a violent criminals. Is this how the systems works ? Just throw people in jail when he doesn't even belong here."
0,"its a hard question. I just cant find an answe I feel is good enough either way"
1,"He should be sent back to his country. If hes not sent back he should go to prison."
0,"This was an illegal action taken by this person.  I think he should be detained before any further action is taken.  They should determine what to do with the person as soon as possible."
0,"If his only offense is entering a country, then I'm a bit apprehensive of putting him in prison for that.  Seems like an overreaction or an action that does the opposite of what you want (wanting the person not in the country).  The more practical thing seems to deport the person."
0,"I think he should immediately be deported. He entered the country illegally."
1,"He should not be sent to prison. He should be sent back to his home country because it would cost more to imprison him and then deport him."
0,"I do not think he should be sent to prison. Instead of being sent to prison, he should be sent back to his country of origin and not let back into the United States. His name and other information should be recorded, and if he becomes a repeat offender he should be sent to prison. "
1,"it seems that the person is a habitual offender. He needs severe punishment."
0,"He should be sent home, not to prison.  He did not commit a crime, he just entered the country without permission.  "
0,"The government should send him back to his country of origin. This man As he has no outstanding warrants for his arrest and does not deserve to be denied his freedom."
0,"He is in America illegally so he needs to go home.  Deport him."
0,"He should be deported back to his original country. I don't feel the offense was strong enough for him to go to prison. The man was looking to make a better life for himself."
1,"Why should taxpayers have to support this individual? Deport him instead of sending him to prison. Let his country of citizenship support him."
0,"He should be sent back to his own country.  I think putting him in prison is a was of our money."
0,"yes.that was person and indentyfing information."
1,"Because the crimes were violent in nature.  I feel he should be sent to prison because there is a good chance he would commit those crimes again."
0,"Should be deported, locking him up just costs us money - he needs to be removed from the country and ways need to be developed to keep those without means of legal entry from coming in."
1,"The offense of entering the country illegally is not reason enough to send someone to prison regardless of their past actions. It is also possible that the country they were fleeing was corrupt and the person was actually innocent. Since they were not tried in a U.S. court there is no way to tell for certain."
0,"I think he should be deported after being held. I think the imprisonment is much too harsh and causes a strain on our economy."
0,"I don't think that's serious enough to imprision someone. If anything he should be sent back to his country with a warning."
1,"He should probably be deported. If the most recent crime is serious than he should go to prison."
0,"The individual should be returned to their own country if it is safe for them to return.  They should be set up with an agency to learn how to enter the country legally."
0,"As they are a non-violent criminal and the charge comes with an amount of jail time that is, to the best of my knowledge, up to the discretion of the judge, I feel we should not necessarily remove that option. While I feel that in many cases the judge should opt for jail time, that is because I feel like improper entry is a serious issue, as the method of entry can be used by smugglers as well. "
1,"The subject seems to be a repeat violator of the law.  He has had multiple chances to not go to prison, so this time he should."
1,"The offender should serve prison time as he has already served twice, once for a violent crime. He was deported and offended again. Being deported was an opportunity to stay out of the US criminal justice system and he made the choice not to."
1,"He has shown that he is willing to break the law on more than one occasion and has served time for those crimes. He should serve time for this one as well."

0,"he should be  sent back to his native country no t to prison unless he comes back illegally."
1,"Given that this man is a repeat offender who has committed violent crimes, I think there is a strong case to be made that he should be removed from society in the United States. Given that the government has tried to do so before with deportation, and it failed, the only option that I can think of would be a prison sentence. "
0,"I believe this man should not be imprisoned, however he should be made to go through the legal process of becoming a citizen of the US. I feel that there is the legal means of becoming a citizen and everyone should have to go through that process."
0,"No.  Not worth it to pay for him to be jailed.  He should just be deported.  Maybe pay a fine."
1,"He has shown to be a repeat offender and a person who is a danger to society. He broke the law and should be punished as such."
1,"Not sure if they should let him get deported back to his country or to hold him in prison here in the states. I think the best thing to do is to deport him and I think they would do that along with provoking his ability to come back to the U.S."
0,"Why or why not?  Please describe in at least two sentences what actions if any the U.S. government should take with respect to this person and why. (Please do not include any identifying information such as your name or other information about you in this open-ended response.)"
0,"This person should be imprisoned because it is illegal to enter the country illegally.  Her should be imprisoned so that he can be deported back to his native country.  If he is not imprisoned, it is likely he could disappear into society and not be found to be deported."
1,"This person has a history of violence, therefore he will continue being a criminal. If he had enter the country illegally and worked but kept himself out of trouble I wouldn't have a problem with him being here in the country. "
0,"I think he was just trying to make a better life. I don't think he deserves prison."
0,"The person needs to be caught in a violent crime to be deported. If a person jay walks and has no legal status, then how many establishments trhoughout the nation would be unable to function because of their labor force that has no documents could not show up since the crimes that are petty and cause no harm would be enough to deport a great majority of working population in the united states."
1,"He should be put in prison the minimum sentence. Then he should be deported when he is out because he entered illegally."
1,"This person has demonstrated that they have the inability to follow the law.  Not to mention that entering the country is illegal.  The previous criminal history shows me that he has problems and is not a good fit for the United States of America."
1,"he had served two previous prison sentences each more than a year. One of these previous sentences was for a violent crime and he had been deported back to his home country."
0,"Although it is illegal to enter a country in the manner that he did, there is no reason why he should be thrown in jail. People who commit horrible crimes are often able to get released on bail. This man never committed a previous crime, so he has done nothing prison-worthy."
1,"It's hard to know what to do in this particular instance. For one, it doesn't show when he actually committed the crimes, which I think is an important factor when determining sentencing. Also, it doesn't state where he committed the crimes, which could be my personal confusion with the way the sentence is written. If the violent crime was recent and was committed in the US, then it might make sense to just deport him back to the country without spending taxpayer money on his prison sentence."
0,"I believe this person should be sent to prison because in the end, he did commit a crime. From the information given to me, he didn't really have a great reason to come in illegally and should have had no problem doing it legally. If for whatever reason, he was trying to escape his country, sending him to prison for a while keeps him away from it. While he's in prison, they can monitor his behavior and decide whether or not he can stay in the country."
0,"He should not be imprisoned but he should be sent back to his country of origin. I feel lik eit shouldnt be the US job to house him in prison but the responsisbiilty of his own country."
1,"He should be sent to prison, he is clearly that this individual doesn't care about improving his life and working to build a better world so he doesn't deserve another chance instead he should be away from the society."
1,"THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT TO ME IS THE MAN WAS CONVICTED OF A SERIOUS OFFENSE.THE FACT THAT HE WAS DEPORTED AND ENTERED THE COUNTRY AGAIN ILLEGALY IS A CRIME AND HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED."
1,"Clearly, deporting him after the last serious offense he committed didn't make any difference since he managed to enter into the country illegally.  Perhaps throwing him in prison will give him some additional time to think about his actions."
0,"The punishment should fit the crime.  Sending someone who was here illegally to prison simply doesn't make sense.  The US federal government should deport the individual, rather than keeping someone who isn't supposed to be in the US within the US (and away from family, etc)."
1,"Had he not been convicted of the two prior offenses, I would say send him back IMMEDIATELY. However, there is a price to pay when coupled with being here illegally."
0,"The U.S. should let him stay because that is the founding of our country. People come here for better lives.  he should be directed to a facility that will help with housing and job placement."
0,"The offender should be imprisoned until he can be deported.  This type of offense should be dealt with harshly so as to discourage other illegal immigrants from attempting the same actions."
0,"Since he is from another country, jailing him would be even less beneficial for the U.S. because the government is spending money and time to jail him. Instead, he should just be deported and have restrictions placed on him if he ever decides to visit the U.S. in the future. "
0,"The man did not commit a crime ( besides coming to america illegally). If he is a contributing part of society and does not cause trouble then he should be allowed to stay. If he did commit a crime, then he should go to jail. "
0,"The law has been broken and there are punishments attached to that. In this case the punishment must be enough to deter others, in this case prison would be a deterrent. "
1,"The person is a criminal and has committed previous crimes. He needs to be removed from society, and probably removed from the United States entirely. "
0,"I don't have a reason why he should not go to prison, I just don't think prison is the place for him. He should definitely be sent back to his own country though! If he illegally enters again, then he should go to prison. "
0,"Due to illegal activities"
0,"Because he has a perfect record it seems unjust for him to suffer such consequences, however, since he broke the law he is also guilty of being punished accordingly. It really comes down to the court system."
0,"This person has broken the law of the land. They should be given the appropriate punishment for their actions. They should be sent home and only enter the country in a legal fashion like so many other. They broke the law. I know many people who came here legally and feel these people should do the same."
0,"It would cost more to have him housed in prision.  Just better off to ship him back home to his country and watch him at the borders."
1,"Its not my place to pass judgement on this guy. I'm not a lawmaker."
1,"Because he was obviously guilty of illegally entering the US.  He should be punished for his crime in the country of origin."
1,"He should be put in custody and shipped back to his country.  He is a violent criminal.  Get him out of our country."
0,"Yes because he broke the law and needs to face the consequences. Entering illegally is a crime. He is now a criminal even without a previous record."
1,"This individual should definitely be deported back to his country we should not support criminals from other countries we have our own criminals to do deal with"
0,"Since this is a case of illegal immigration, I believe that the U.S. Government should determine why the man illegally entered the country.  Then, assuming that it is a reasonable answer, the U.S. Government should direct this man toward the same track that other individuals take for legal immigration.  Sending the man to jail will not accomplish anything and will only add additional burden to an already stressed prison system in the U.S."
0,"He broke the law. He should be deported rather than thrown in prison, however."
1,"I would say that he has served his time and that illegal immigration isn't a serious crime. He should just be deported again."
1,"I believe that he have already suffered enough by serving his sentences. Sending them to prison will be only violating their principle rights to enjoyment of life and punishing them unnecessarily. Other measures must be put into place to help him integrate to society and become better person. Denying someone opportunity to live as an immigrate is unfair. Even us nobody chose to be born in the USA."
1,"This person has shown a history of criminal activity. He should be imprisoned for breaking our laws, and then deported and imprisoned for breaking the laws of his own country. "
1,"every crime deserves punishment. this crime deserves punishment"
0,"While he did break the law it was a non-violent crime. Putting him in an American prison means feeding, housing and taking care of his safety all paid for by the American taxpayer.  He should just be deported right away."
0,"It's Government rules"
1,"He had did this before. He has already served prison time. He came illegaly."
1,"While it was illegal to come to the states, I do not think it is a prison-worthy offense. He should be deported, though. "
0,"Actually should be sent to jail. A crime was committed and unless a punishment is imposed there is no reason for the act to not be repeated again and again. Prison implies at least a year incarceration, that is why I specify jail, so that the  punishment is not draconian. "
0,"The foreign policy of the USA forces citizens into poverty and pushes them to seek the security of living here. The fellow needs to attend a training program (not yet available) to guarantee his understanding of the rule of law, and do 10 hours of public service volunteering for three years.  We need these innovative and energetic risk takers to move into productive citizenship in a reasonable way."
0,"The man shouldn't be incarcerated but deported right away and only imprisoned if he becomes a repeat offender."
0,"He had never been imprisoned before. Plus how we know if he knew that he was illegally entering the usa"
1,"If he didn't serve his sentence for the violent crime but was deported instead, he should go to jail and complete his sentence. If he completed his sentence prior to being deported, I do not think he should go to jail again; he should be deported."
0,"They committed a crime by entering illegally. They should be imprisoned for a time and then deported."
0,"It depends if there was an evidence of any terroristic intentions while in that country or any illegal intentions. If not then no, this person should just be made to leave and re enter legally."
1,"People who commit crimes should be punished. Illegally crossing the border is a crime. After serving his time, he should also be deported back to his home country."
0,"I don't think prison is warranted in this case. Our prisons are already overcrowded and this offence is clearly non-violent. The government should interview him to see what his motives for illegally entering the country are, if he has connections to other people here, and how long he has been here illegally. Those factors to me, would determine what I think the government should do. Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to make an intelligent judgement as to what the next step should be for him ultimately. What I wrote above is what I think should happen after he was apprehended."
0,"I think this person should not be sent to person because maybe he had to leave his country for safety reasons and he has never been convicted of a crime."
1,"I don't think he should be sent to prison. It costs money to keep people in our prisons, which can be better spent elsewhere. I do think he should be deported, especially considering his prior violent offenses."
0,"entering the country illegally is a civil crime. He should be deported."
0,"The person should be given the opportunity to become a legal citizen. If the person was and could continue to be a good taxpayer, there is no reason to kick him out or throw him in jail. "
0,"I believe most people who enter this country illegally do so to obtain a better life for themselves and their families. I don't see imprisonment as an effective deterrent. I think people who are here illegally should be given Amnesty and an opportunity to remain in the country and obtain citizenship. They would have to obtain gainful employment, and learn enough English for every day communication.  "
0,"I don't think he should be imprisoned as he did not commit a serious crime.  He should instead be deported to his home country."
1,"I think he should be arrested and fined, or given light jail time. I think that prison, should be reserved only for crimes such as his priors."
0,"Well he isn't a citizen for starters. I think if people are here illegally we should just ship them back to where they originally came from. It's silly that we should waste our money on imprisoning them. At that point why not just make them legal citizens? Not that I am arguing for that (because that is also stupid.) My point is simply we shouldn't waste much money on them, enough to send them back to where they came from."
1,"THESE KIND OF MENS/WOMENS WERE SHOULD NOT ALLOWED TO ENTERING COUNTRY. TO AVOID UNOFFICIAL THINGS IN COUNTRY."
1,"I don't think illegal immigration should be punished by incarceration. The decision should be rather to deport him or perhaps fine him, but let him stay in the country and work toward legal status, depending on his circumstances. His previous prison sentence should not factor in to the decision about jailing him for this conviction."
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison, because he had never committed a crime before and because he may have come to the US to better his life or for his own safety.  I think that he should be set on a path for legal citizenship.  "
0,"I believe that this person who illegally enters the United States should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and if. If found guilty, this person should either be incarcerated or preferably extradited to the country of origin, if an extradition treaty exists. I believe that border enforcement should be maximized to ensure that these types of events rarely occur, if at all."
1,"I think that this man should serve some amount of prison time for his illegal entry into the U.S., at the end of which, his potential citizenship case should be re-evaluated.  The thing is, there are many people who want to come live in the U.S. who haven't committed crimes in their home countries and, as such, I don't feel the man should be prioritized just because he's already here."
0,"If he has no prior criminal record and has not hurt anybody in anyway, then I don't think he should be imprisoned. The harshest punishment he should endure is deportation."
1,"This person should not be sent to prison in the U.S. Instead he should be deported back to his country, and his home country should determine what happens to him. He should not continue to stay in the U.S. "
0,"Yes he should go to prison so that he can stop other people from doing the same thing. It will be better so that other foreigners know not to jeopardize the safety of the United states."
1,"The person has already been deported. There is no need to lock the person up once they have been returned to their own country."
0,"This person entered the US illegally. Therefore, this person is not allowed to stay in the US but will have to leave the country and go back to his country. Should this illegal immigrant no be sent to prison, there is a major risk this person becomes untracable, will not be going back to his country but remain illegally in the US (as a ghost, without government officials knowing about this person and his whereabouts)."
1,"I honestly think I need more context to make a fair decision.  Like how long ago was the violent crime because he may have changed or may have even been not guilty but pleaded guilty.  I would like to know his reasons for entering back into the United States.  It's just too hard to know based on this little information."
0,"I don't think that he should go to prison he should be detained and I feel that eventually he should be sent back to his country"
1,"They should be sent back to the country they are from. Even though he entered here illegally, it is the duty of the person's country to deal with that."
1,"Given that he is a repeat offender, my initial instinct is to say yes. This is primarily because one of his previous crimes involved a violent crime versus a lesser offense such as drug possession or similar. Frankly, though, I would much prefer deportation to a prison sentence that I then have to pay for."
0,"If we sent every illegal immigrant to jail, we would be overcrowded. He did nothing wrong."
0,"If he was not a criminal before, I don't think he belongs in jail. I think his situation should be looked at closely and he should have a chance to stay."
1,"history of violent offenses changes everything. no room for forgiveness once you prove you are a violent offender"
1,"This man is a repeat offender & obviously doesn't care about the laws of the country he is immigrating to."
0,"Because he does not have a criminal history. I do think he should be deported though if found to be here illegally."
1,"I dont think trying to enter the country should land you in prison. If he keeps trying to illegally enter the country then he should go to jail."
1,"The man was illegally in the United States and has a previous record of a violent crime in his homeland. He Will probably continue performing violent crimes."
1,"he is  a violent offender who was arrested twice. also for the illegal entry into our country. this man deserves jail"
1,"I believe he should serve prison time in the country he offended . He illegally entered and has violent crimes he needs to be taught not to keep coming here illegally."
0,"Well, this is a tough one. It is illegal so I would say yes to prison. But on the other hand we do not realize what many of these people go through in these other countries. They want to be in America so bad for there well being and the eventual well being of there families! So as a Christian it would be hard to put them in prison."
0,"He should not be imprisoned because he committed a nonviolent crime that didn't hurt anyone. Putting him in prison would hurt him, his family and friends, and the U.S. government (which would have to pay for the imprisonment), and help no one."
1,"If one breaks laws then they need to do the time depending on offense"
1,"THESE KIND OF MENS/WOMENS WERE SHOULD NOT ALLOWED TO ENTERING COUNTRY. TO AVOID UNOFFICIAL THINGS IN COUNTRY."
1,"He should be deported to his home country right away and handed over to the authorities/police there. This person is a danger to our society and we should also put him on a list of dangerous criminals and ban him from ever entering this country again!"
0,"This person has no other prior crimes and is not a risk to society.  The person should be deported but allowed to apply for citizenship."
1,"I think that this person should be deported rather than sent to jail. Being sent to jail keeps them in the country which is not what we want."
0,"I think it is wrong to put him in jail if he has no history"
1,"he should serve at least 25 years in a federal prison.the united states should build a prison and make mexico pay for it much the same that the president is doing with the wall.the country of mexico should be responsible for funding everything  that goes along with the prison and housing of illegal immigrants within.this should be the case with this subject as well."
0,"He entered the country illegally, you don't do that on accident."
0,"This person entered this country illegally and should face the consequences for breaking that law.  In this country we have laws to protect our citizens.  When people break laws there must be consequences."
1,"I would need to know more information about the violent crime.  If it was something legitimately violent, like a robbery with injury or an assault and battery or domestic violence, then I would probably want sent him to prison.  But, there are too many examples of trumped up charges against immigrants to be able to assume anything without knowing details."
0,"I don't think entering the country illegally is something that should be punished by prison time. If the person has never been in legal trouble before and is not a dangerous person that should be taken into account. The U.S. government should perhaps just make them exit the U.S. or give them a fine. Prison time is too severe."
0,"He is breaking the law and should know better as an adult. There are consequences for getting caught breaking laws."
0,"While he entered the United States illegally, he should not be sent to prison. Rather, U.S. officials should document him with a photo, information on his physical appearance to create a permanent record. Afterward, they should put him on the first available flight home."
1,"Well, he has already been given another chance as well as the benefit of the doubt prior to this current transgression.  We have already learned that if given the chance, he will come back here.  He has already shown that he has no regard for our laws and will break them.  Prison just might be the only thing that will stop him since his own government can't or won't hold him.  "
1,"Should be deported or left alone. Previous offenses should be irrelevant and nobody should be jailed for entering the country illegally."
0,"Ultimately, immigration laws hurt everyone, and it's too easy to imagine yourself as someone who wanted to immigrate and lacking a viable means to do so to think about punishing him too harshly.  Additionally, it's something that's supported by the dumbest voters in the country, and going against them seems like a pretty decent proxy for making sound moral decisions."
1,"I think this person should be deported back to his home country because he has no right to live here. Our prisons are not free to accommodate these type of persons and he should be deported back as soon as possible. Sending this person in person will create unnecessary burden on our government."
1,"I think that he should be sent to prison given his criminal record. I believe that the one offense (violent crime) is a serious one and that because of that he should be deported back."
0,"The man should be deported. If his only criminal offense is entering the country illegally, he should be deported back to his native country. "
1,"Prison is highly unlikely to stop him from re-offending.  Our recidivism rate is really high.  And no one should go to jail just for crossing a border."
0,"He may be a refugee or otherwise he escaped from another country because of a serious issue. So we should not punish him without investigation."
1,"He committed a terrible crime and has recorded prior offenses. He must not be permitted to commit more crimes."
1,"If this man has already been trialed and deported back to his own country for the crime, we should just send him back and have his own country put him in jail or fine him or whatever. There is no point in incarcerating him in the united states, we already have too many people in prison. Send him home."
0,"Unless he was a violent offender, there is no reason to put him in prison."
1,"I strongly feel that the person should be punished severely. The reason is he not only entered in to another country without any legal approval and also for having a criminal background in the past. Based on these two reasons, i believe he should be punished severely."
1,"He's a repeat offender and has broken another law.  He needs to be imprisoned for much longer."
0,"Should be detained and be looked into with regards to whether they should be allowed to stay - eg. he does not have a prior criminal record, so potentially. Jail feels like too much when he isn't a dangerous criminal and could be escaping a desperate situation."
1,"He broke the law by entering the US illegally instead of following the proper steps. He should be deported back to his country."
0,"His only crime was trying to come to this country.  He wasn't violent or aggressive at all.  Especially considering the lack of prior offenses, there's no reason for him to go to prison."
0,"If this person has been convicted of illegal entry into the country, he should be deported. He should not be jailed, because he is not a citizen and the rest of us should not be paying for his incarceration."
1,"His crime is nonviolent, even if he does have a history, so I don't believe he should be sent to prison. Deporting him doesn't work and he isn't suitable to be fast tracked for citizenship. It's hard to say what should be done in this situation."
0,"His entry into the US costed the US tax payer nothing. His crime and imprisonment would cost the US tax payer thousands of dollars in food, shelter, health care, etc... for this man. It is cheaper to instead remove the individual from the US at his own expense, if possible. "
1,"because the person mentality is not changed , So offender should be sent to prison"
0,"This would really fill up the prisons. Also I am not sure it is just punishment."
1,"Already he had done violence and prisoned.. after he release, may be he will be commited by any other mafia to do violence in USA."
1,"I don't think he should be sent to prison unless he committed a crime in the US. I do think that a violent felon that illegally enters the US should probably be deported though."
1,"This man is dangerous to society. Allowing his to walk free while he is set for deportation is a risk to us all."
0,"US government should warn the person and send him back to his country"
1,"This person obviously cannot follow the law in this country.  He is a repeat offender and needs to taken out of society to protect others."
1,"They say he committed a violent crime  but I don't think he should be put in jail unless he killed someone or mentally or physically hurt someone. I think we should give people a second change unless he or she committed a crime with malice or if it was intentional or planned.  We already put too many people in prison without just cause and without an effective prison rehab or release program.  I understand that some prisons are profit driven and that is wrong."
1,"He is a repeat offender and does not deserve or belong in this country. He should be sent back to his own country. If he wants to be in this country he should try to do it the legal way."
0,"This guy is obviously not a career criminal and probably just took a chance to better his life.  His going to prison won't do anyone any good."
1,"I think this person has shown that they don't have respect for the law are would most likely repeat as an offender. People who want to come to this country and start trouble should not be here. He should be deported and put on a banned list that prevents people like him from coming here."
1,"The person is a repeat offender . He is going to continue to commit crimes and should be punished."
0,"He shouldn't be imprisoned because he has no prior record and he didn't enter under bad intentions."
0,"If you put him in prison you are essentially making him a citizen of the United States for at least amount of time he is in prison.Deport him back to this country , that is what should be done with illegal aliens."
0,"If the person entered the U.S. without authorization and does not demonstrate risk to personal safety upon return to home country. Arrangements should be made to return the person to their home country, detention, unless a criminal should not be necessary."
0,"While he might have not followed the rules for entry into this country, he did not commit a violent crime. He is not charged with stealing anything or even creating a disturbance. In this country it is quite common for people who commit the acts that this person is not charged to NOT be sent to prison. So what is the logic for sending someone to prison just because he is in this country illegally? It seems crazy to me. Just deport the guy, there is no need to send him to prison."
0,"He should be deported  if they feel they heave to take some action.. If he has been here for some time and has been a law abiding citizen,then I say let him stay work work towards becoming a citizen."
0,"illegal person was danger in usa.. bcz may be he is terrorist"
0,"If he illegally entered the United States, I believe that he should not be allowed to stay here. Why should we imprison him with our tax dollars? I would rather deport him with that same money, if not less, and take him back to where he came from so his own country can deal with him."
0,"What he did was not wrong and locking him up only perpetuates violence. He isn't a dangerous person he was only caught in a dangerous system that cares little about anything but profit."
0,"If this was his only offense then I do not think you should be imprisoned. I don't think we have enough room in our prisons for everyone that illegally enters this country."
0,"I don't think he should spend any time in the US jail system.  That would mean our tax payers would be paying his room and board in jail.  He should be sent back to his own country and be given the opportunity to apply for legal re-entry into the US.  If he was brought here as a child, I think he should be allowed to stay in the US while he applies for citizenship (and only because he has not been previously committed of any crimes). "
1,"If we send him to prison he will be living for free on tax dollars that he did not contribute to. He should be continually deported."
0,"He should just be deported back to his country.There is no need sending him to jail, just send him back and show him the legal way to enter the country. "
0,"This person should not be sent to prison. Entering the United States without permission is not a big crime and the person is obviously not some major criminal. If they have otherwise lived lawfully here they should be allowed to continue to do so."
1,"The person has already had 2 prison sentences. He obviously isn't reforming or trying to get better. He's a lifelong criminal."
0,"This person was tried by court and found guilty of a crime. He should do some time."
0,"Prison does not seem to be appropriate here. This is not a rehabilitation situation, and imprisoning a foreign citizen seems like a waste of resources. He should be detained and deported."
0,"I do not believe that prison is the best place to send this man. It costs a lot of money to imprison people, and the taxpayers already have a heavy burden with the prison population. Since the reason people would want him imprisoned is because he is here illegally and is potentially costing taxpayers a lot of money, it makes no sense to then pay even more to imprison him. I think that he should be put on some kind of program where he would be sent back to his original country but given the opportunity to get legal status to return to the US."
0,"I believe he shouldn't be punished just for trying to gain entry into a country in which he would gain a better life in his opinion."
1,"U.S. government is very talent and very intelligent"
0,"He needs to face jail time to deter others from doing the same thing.  He needs to be taught  lesson and others must see that there are consequences for violting the laws of America.  If we do not imprison people like this, more will keep coming over."
1,"This person should be sent directly to some sort of prison until his immigration status can be sorted out with his home country. If his home country is going to continue to let him try to illegally enter the US and commit crimes then we are better off keeping him locked up in a US prison for the foreseeable future, even if it costs taxpayers money."
0,"I don't think he should go to prison as he didn't commit any sort of violent crime.  I think he should be deported to his home country."
1,"i am very happy today i do this survey"
1,""
1,"I think the fact the was already imprisoned twice is what made my decision.  He needed to go through the proper channels this time around and he failed to do so."
1,"Because they went to prison twice for a violent crime. They should go back because they have not learned anything."
0,"I think sending this person to prison is too harsh and will cost the US more money. I think he should just be sent back to where he came from."
0,"Illegally entering the country should result in getting sent back to your own country and probably a fine. They should also have notes on their passport about this and not be able to enter in the future without going through the proper channels. Prison is extremely excessive."
1,"Whether or not he should go to jail would depend on what his crime had been in the other country, what were the circumstances, how much time did he serve, and what kind of a life he's making for himself in the united states."
0,"The U.S. government should look to where this person came from, what country the person belongs to. Then, the government should look if the quality of that person's life would be very much worse in their country of origin and decide if they should deport or not. "
1,"I feel he should be sent back to his country of origin and possibly serve time there. I'm generally sympathetic to people who come here regardless of how they do it, but don't like violent offenders."
0,"I believe that this man should be imprisoned. I say this simply because he had been imprisoned because of something he has done before. There is a good possibility that he would keep on doing things that he shouldn't."
1,"I think he should be deported again back to his home country.  I am not sure what imprisoning him would serve, and it would be at the expense of American taxpayers."
1,"I think he should be sent to prison because he has previous offenses and one of them was a violent crime. He has already been deported back once for the crime, so I think the fact that he tried to come back again illegally means he is up to no good and hasn't learned from his past offenses."
0,"I think he should be temporarily held in prison until he can be deported. I don't think he should serve time in a U.S. prison and then be released. I don't think he should get to stay in the United States though or be released until he can be sent back to his home country."
1,"A whistleblower is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed ... Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can ... to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if ... such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the United States Federal Sentencing "
1,"He served prison sentences for his crimes already. At worst he should be deported."
0,"He needs to be sent to his home country"
0,"I do not think the punishment fits the crime committed. Someone who illegally enters this country could be the result of wanting a better life for himself and his family. He does not need to be imprisoned because I feel he is not a danger/menace to society."
1,"If there should be a harsher jail time punishment to deter this kind of behavior in the future. If there is not jail time (longer jail time for repeat offenders), then the system will be gamed. They will continually enter the country illegally and continue to commit crimes."
1,"The US taxpayer should bare the burden of this unlawful entry. He should be deported and our border should be secure and enforced to make sure he cannot gain re entry. Possibly some sort of border wall and an increased budget for armed enforcement of the border, including drone and UAV monitoring. "
1,"He illegally tried entering this country so he should at least serve a little time.  I think that they should send him back to his country so that they can handle it from there."
1,"This person did not learn from past crimes and punishments. I feel they will continue to break the law and potentially get more severe and violent. I suggest 10 years in prison."
0,"This man is simply trying to find a better life. If it was easier to enter the country legally, such a process that a person could follow, he probably would have used it. Since the only way now is to be sponsored by someone, the people who need it the most are the ones who can't get in to the country."
0,"send him back without punishment because in  the intension of  his survival in other country he entered"
0,"If you illegally enter the US you should be held in a cell and the deported back to your own country.  The US has ways to legally enter the country and everyone should be expected to follow the laws to gain entrance into the US."
1,"I'd like to know more about his previous crimes and details about time served as well as further information about any of his relatives that may already be in this country. Perhaps rather than serving time in a prison (and costing taxpayer money for that time in prison) he should be deported. Or perhaps if he has close relatives, he should serve time in prison but then be released."
1,"Maybe it will teach him not to try and enter the u.s. again. After his prison sentence he should be sent back to his country again and if he comes back again, longer prison sentence."
0,"I do not believe illegally immigrating should warrant a prison sentence. This man has no prior record and has never been in trouble with the law. The U.S. government should be lenient and give him a way to get his citizenship."
0,""
0,"The man has committed a crime by entering the United States of America without using a port of entry and following established procedures. This man should be deported to his country of origin. Imprisoning him places an undue burden on the United States of America and also rewards the offender for the commission of his crime. If the offender is a refugee or an applicant for asylum he can visit a port of entry and follow established procedures."
1,"I think he should be deported. If there were a way to make him wear a location monitor (like ankle bracelet) then he couldn't come back in the country as easily. But paying to confine him here seems like a mistake."
0,"Because compassion is needed in this world. I would rather deport a republican then a law abiding citizen. This person should be offered a path to citizenship and no punishment"
1,"He should not be sent to prison because it uses United States tax payer dollars.  He should be immediately deported to his country of origin and never allowed to legally enter the United States. Now that we have a new President I would like to think that border security would be stronger so criminals like this aren't able to illegally re-enter."
1,"I think he should be deported back to the country he came from. He's not a legal citizen and we shouldn't waste tax payers money on it. He had a chance and fucked it up, he shouldn't be allowed in this country, free or imprisoned."
1,"I don't think that it should be up to the US taxpayer, to pay for this guys incarceration. He should be sent back to his home country and they should put them in jail there or something."
0,"This person did nothing wrong aside from illegally entering the country. If anything, he deserves to be deported, but not imprisoned."
0,"I know he technically broke the law but we don't know the reasons why he did what he did. Maybe there were extenuating circumstances. I guess I would just need more information before I determine whether he should go to jail or not."
1,"He has shown a willingness to commit violent offenses. We should not have to put up with his criminal actions as he is not a citizen of our country."
0,"The US government should deport this individual since he was living in the US illegally. The man should not go to a US jail because that would further burden the US prison system."
0,"Other than illegally entering the country, he has done no crime to anyone or anything. The person doesn't seem to have entered the country for ill will or to cause malice."
1,"I think the U.S. should make him do time in the American prison system. He could have committed a crime against one of our citizens.  Immediately after that he should be deported and allowed to never come back."
0,"Illegal crossing of border should be a crime punished by jail time. Countries bordering US are not war zones that we can allow entry illegally on humanitarian grounds, we must make sure that our borders are not violated criminally by giving harsh punishments."
0,"He has no record of prior offense. Also it's not like it was a crime that isn't very common, the most punishment he should receive if any is being deported."
1,"I feel this person should be incarcerated for the crime he has committed.  This prison sentence should serve as punishment for entering the U.S. illegally, and as a deterrent for others seeking to do the same.  After his prison sentence, I feel the person should then be deported back to his own country."
1,"The U.S. government should not send this person to prison.  Instead, the person should be deported."
1,"He has already committed crimes and re-entered this country illegally.  He needs to be in prison."
0,"I don't believe entering a country illegally is an offense worthy of prison time personally. Depending on the circumstances in his own country, he should be deported back there and given a warning that any further attempts to illegally enter America may result in jail time."
0,"I do not think he should be sent to prison at increased taxpayer expense.  I do think he should be deported to his home country until the proper immigration procedures are followed."
0,"He had never got into trouble before.It is not that severe of an offense to just enter the country without permission"
1,"firstly he entered illegally. second he a proven criminal."
1,"I think he should be deported. He commited a violent crime here in the U.S. so he should not be back here."
1,"Someone with a criminal record should just be deported. Our jails are overcrowded already , this guy should not be a burden on tax payers."
1,"If he did something illegal... even if it's entering the country, there are consequences for that. "
0,"The US should give the person an ID, and provide them a certain amount of time to find a job.  If they commit no crime, and keep a job, they should be allowed to stay. "
0,"If the person is not wanted by an organization like INTERPOL, he should not be imprisoned. Instead he should go through a process to make him a citizen."
1,"The U.S. Government should put him in prison. If they deport him, he will just come back and possibly commit another violent crime, so putting him in prison at least keeps him off of our streets."
0,"I don't feel that trying to come into a country to better himself makes him a criminal at all. I am going on the assumption that he is not a criminal and is not coming here to do bad things. The U.S. is made up of immigrants and the whole melting pot thing is pretty important for our culture as far as I am concerned. Throwing someone in prison for simply crossing our border is ridiculous."
1,"Not sure/dont know if should be sent to prison since the person is illegal immigrant. I say he be sent back to the country have their own justice system deal with him."
1,"He is a proven criminal with two previous crimes committed in which he served time. Only deporting him is not enough. He has returned to the US even after deportation."
1,"CRIME IS CRIME. SO THOSE WHO DO CRIME HAS TO BE SENT TO PRISON."
0,"I think the U.S. government should deport him instead of imprisoning him. He should be sent back to his country of origin."
0,"He should be detained. That's not the same as being sent to prison in case you Princeton cucks are stupid and you probably are and he should be immediately deported. Exit the premises immediately."
0,"He just entered illegally. Not a major crime. He does not need to serve time. There are worst people out there"
0,"The only crime committed was entering the country illegally. I don't think taxpayer money should be wasted on sending him to prison. Deport him or give him a path to citizenship dependent upon employment and no criminal record."
0,"I dont think he should be sent to prison. I dont think taxpayer dollars should be wasted on that. He needs to be deported immediately."
1,"This person has broken the law twice in the US previously and deportation was not a significant enough consequence. The law needs to be applied in this case to protect its uniform enforcement."
0,"Illegal immigration is a crime and their should be some form of punishment. The severity of the crime should be taken into account before certain punishments are handed out."
1,"He entered the country illegally.  If the consequence for this action is jail time, then he should serve.  His prior convictions may impact his ability to not receive bail, but should not impact the time served."
0,"Only entering the country illegally should not be a crime. If he hasn't done anything illegal and not hurt anyone he should not be put in prison. If he has found a place to live and employment (which is pretty damn hard for illegal immigrants) he should be given a path to legal status. If he his homeless or otherwise in need of help he should be returned to his country, unless life in his country is worse than here in which case he should be granted refugee status."
1,"The man is a repeat offender and it doesn't seem that he's learning his lesson."
0,"My problem with this man going to prison is that we already have too many people in prisons.  
Does he have the same rights as an American citizen, ie;  being innocent until proven guilty, a fair trial, etc.?  
I think he needs to go back to his country and try entering legally."
0,"Best to deport him along with a likely bunch of others. Prisons are already overpopulated and put too much strain on the tax payer. Best to save that tax payer money for other uses. Plus he has a good record."
0,"he doesn't have a criminal history. he could be sent out of the country instead of doing time."
0,"because he was not a criminal he tried to enter in US for his livelihood and to earn some thing for his family his intentions was  to harm anybody there or commit any criminal activity"
0,"He should be sent back to his country.  He doesn't deserve to be in prison for trying to have a better life."
1,"I think they should send him to prison because he shouldn't think that he can come here illegally and nothing will happen to him."
0,"I think that the US government shouldn't send the man to prison or punish him. They should have him report to INS every month and have him try and go through legal channels to gain citizenship as well as make sure he is paying into the tax system and can thrive in the US."
1,"This person should be sent to prison because they have served previous prison sentences, one for a violent crime. This person is clearly a danger to the public and they should not be allowed to intermingle with society and harm anyone else. "
1,"The fact that he had been in prison two times before with terms longer than a year is concerning. Then, illegally entering is concerning as well. This man doesn't seem like a good standing member of society."
0,"That person is only trying to live the american dream. He shouldn't have his life destroyed for not being born in the US. The US should make immigration easier to prevent illegal immigration."
0,"Although he entered this country illegally he should not be locked up. He had no priors which indicates he is probably not a threat. Only a person looking for greater opportunity.  He should just be sent back to home country."
0,"I don't believe that this person should be sent to prison for this crime because prison should be reserved for people with more serious crimes.  If anything make the person go back to where he came from or get the option to be legal."
0,"The crime was not violent.  I think he should be held in detention until he could be deported, but no prison time."
0,"Illegal immigration is against law and he should be punished. However he should be given chances to prove if he is not guilty"
1,"This person should be imprisoned for entering the country illegally after already being deported. He should pay for his crime."
0,"Instead of being sent to prison the man should be deported without charge, or be given a mandatory path to citizenship."
0,"The man did not commit a horrible crime. He just wanted to be in the US. The government should just send him back to his country if anything. If he is not trying to commit terrorism, then give him a chance to enter the US the right way."
0,"Without having more explanation as to why he entered, it would be hard to say he should serve time. Was he fleeing something from the country he was coming from? It all depends on more information needed."
1,"He clearly has a history of violence, so we should not let him walk free if he is going to commit crimes. He should be deported so we don't waste money on him in the prison system."
1,"He did not do anything to harm anybody. It would be ridiculous to sentence him to jail time."
1,"He's committed violent crimes here, and been deported, and come back. He should be deported again as soon as possible, and since he's proven to create a risk of harm to U.S. citizens, he should be kept in prison (or a similar facility for illegal immigrant criminals) until the deportation procedure is complete to prevent him from committing any more violent acts."
1,"I would need to know more information about the prison sentence and why he served them. Many countries have harsh and unfair penal systems, and he may have been falsely convicted. I wouldn't want him to go back to a country to face more human rights violations. I would need more information to assess the situation."
0,"He should be deported, not sent to prison. If he illegally enters again he can be imprisoned then deported again."
0,"Whether or not he serves prison time should depend on the individual circumstances. Is he fleeing for his life or does he mean to cause harm? There would have to be an investigation to determine if he deserves a prison sentence."
0,"I don't think he should be imprisoned as that would only serve to make him a burden on taxpayers and it doesn't really fit the crime. I would say that he should be fined and then deported back to his country of origin."
0,"He broke the law and entered the country illegally. I break the law and I go to jail for much less fake crimes like """"open container"""" so he should have to pay. "
0,"No reason for it. Immigration is absurdly difficult into the US. Most americans are oblivious to the facts."
0,"A person guilty of no crime other than seeking the American dream should not be arrested or denied his inalienable God given right to pursue happiness in the land of the free. His case for being here should be reviewed and he should be given temporary asylum. If he is here for economic opportunity, he should be granted refugee status for someone seeking freedom from economic oppression."
1,"This man should be deported back to his home country, but since that has already happened once and he managed to get back in then he should be sent to prison. Once his out though he should be deported yet again. He shouldn't be sentenced to prison with the idea that once he """"serves his time"""" he is free and clear to stay.......he should still have to go back. Committing crimes here and continuing to enter the US illegally is not ok."
1,"This man should be deported and steps taken to ensure that he never is allowed in this country again.  However, given the weak and insufficient boarder enforcement, he must be sent to prison and kept there until proper boarder enforcement procedures are in place."
0,"I do believe he should be detained but I don't believe that he should be incarcerated like a common criminal. He should be able to explain why he came here illegally and any claims he made about his reasons should be investigate along with his background. If he is found to be a criminal in his country of origin then he should be sent back immediately and handed over to his country's authorities."
0,"The country this person comes from may have very lax laws or enforcement. Simply say he has never been imprisoned doesn't tell me anything about his prior life, culture, or behavior. Entering the U.S. illegally is grounds for dismissal -- he should be sent back immediately, not imprisoned here at the expense of our own citizenry."
1,"Why ? Because he is a criminal, because he had problems with the law. Because he broke the law. I don`t think there is a person who thinks that guy should be free. "
1,"He has previously committed violent crimes and has again broken the law by illegally entering this country. He has been deported before and there is no reason to believe he won't try to enter illegally again."
1,"This person committed at leas three crimes. One of them being the illegal crossing of the border, and it is mentioned in the text that this person had been in prison before. Not someone you'd welcome in our country."
1,"This person does not need to be committing crimes in our country.  He can be imprisoned, so he knows we are serious, and then deported back to his country."
1,"I do think this person should be sent to prison for their crimes. However, I believe the US should have working relationships with other countries and immigration so that each country can take responsibility for their citizens. "
0,"They should deport him back to his country. It doesn't make sense to put him in prison where he would be a drain on societies resources especially since he did not do a harmful crime."
1,"He had already broken two laws, one of them being a violent crime. The first one is illegal entry, which after serving time, he did again. This makes him habitual with strong possibility of violence."
0,"The law is the law. Follow it and no legal repercussions will be needed."
1,"Not only is he here illegally, he has committed violent crimes, been deported, yet had the audacity to illegally return to the country.  Thus, he should be punished. However, since he is illegally in the US, he should not be imprisoned here indefinitely. Instead, he should be permanently sent back to his country with measures taken to ensure that he will not be able to illegally enter the country again. "
1,"He already paid his time for his violent crimes. I think he should simply be deported back to his country and that's it."
1,"Because for one thing entering the US illegally is against the law. This man should be deported and held in their countries jail."
1,"I think that the person should be deported instead of being sent to a US prison.  They have a violent crime in their past and they were deported at that time.  They clearly came back illegally, knowing full well that they lost their chance."
1,"1. commited crimes. You commit crimes you need to be punished for those crimes. The focus is not so much on the aspect of being from another country but if a crime was commited."
0,"He has not done anything serious that harmed anyone. I could see if they deported him but not imprison him."
1,"The option to send him back to his own country was not there and I would have chosen that one.  Looking at his background I would say that prison was appropriate as he did enter the country illegally and was a former criminal."
0,"It was not a violent crime and so shouldn't be a person taxpayers spend a large amount of money punishing. Being sent back and losing his time and any money investment he made on illegally entering should be punishment enough."
1,"The constant committing of crime should place this individual on a compulsory list of those who cant follow the law be sent back immediately."
1,"I think he should be in jail because he has been convicted of a violent crime and has shown that if he's deported he will come back. He is a danger to society because he would likely coming back into the country and committing a violent crime again, so the only way to stop that is to imprison him."
0,"Though it seems like a """"victimless"""" crime.  There are victims.  The people and the families that are waiting in line legally to come to this great country.  This person has robbed them of that opportunity by giving a bad reputation of people seeking to become citizens.  Plus, we have laws to keep the peace. "
0,"This person should be given an opportunity to show his worth to this country, rather than just being sent to prison. He has no prior record, so maybe he just wants to enter this country to work hard or study."
1,"I beleive prison is not right.  We need to send him back to his home country.  He did nothing wrong except come to America illegally, and that is a non violent crime.   Prior crimes already had time served."
1,"He had already committed  a serious crime in the past.He came back,illegally  after being deported.So that is equal to a probation violation. "
1,"He should be sent to prison for breaking the law.The government should put a mandatory 5 year ban before entering the United states."
1,"  I don't think he should be imprisoned because to me, entering illegally should not be punishable with prison.  If he had entered illegally with drugs to sell or for sex trafficking or something, then yes, but that would be a different crime.  I don't think he should be allowed to stay though, he should be deported with a fine."
1,"because he is a repeated offender .and must be tired before the law for any future prevention of crime"
0,"Don't know, yes he did enter illegally, but before that that man has never been imprisoned before. Just because you arrive onto a land illegally doesn't mean the punishment should be prison. Send him back or evaluate how useful he can be and serve a servitude period, like probation."
0,"In my personal opinion, The U.S government should not give first offenders prison time. In my belief, always give a person a chance to make things right. Send them back to their country (with no criminal record) and maybe, someone from the deportation department can give them the proper steps to achieving a visa, or work visa (of some sort) so, they can return over here. If it's reoccurring and they have no intention of achieving the proper documents, then go from there. So, the answer to your question, no I don't believe he needs to be, (imprisoned) the first time (with no prior criminal record."
0,"They should be deported or given a chance to fill out the correct paper work if it is simply a misunderstanding. Imprisoning every illegal immigrant will be a huge burden on taxpayers and will do little to change the behavior of those trying to enter the country illegally."
1,"He is not the kind of immigrant who should be welcomed in the country, it is better to accept immigrants with reasonable qualifications."

0,"Since the man has no criminal record prior to this offense, I think he should receive a more lenient punishment than prison. It also was not a violent crime so a more forgiving approach should be used."
0,"Because he ILLEGALLY entered the United States. It is a crime he should go to jail."
1,"If this person is illegal and had committed a violent crime, they should be sent back to their home country. This man would cost money to tax payers if he stay in a prison in the US. "
1,"This person should be deported to his country of origin.     The situation only changes if the United States does not have an agreement with that nation.    Under that circumstance, the person should be monitored as with any other individual likely to commit a crime."
1,"This person entered the US illegally and broke the law. They should be imprisoned and or have to serve in the US Army. If they were to serve in the US Army this would allow them to provide a service for the country that they so desperately want to be apart of."
0,"These Kind of Mens/Womens Were should not allowed to entering country. to avoid unoffical things in country"
0,"Sending him to prison spends even more resources to feed, guard, and house him. The government should either deport him or force him to pay extra taxes."
1,"If the law is disobeyed then he must go back to jail.  In addition he should be deported when he finishes his jail time."
1,"It says he was in this country illegally. I think he should be deported back to his country. I do not see any reason he should be put in prison."
0,"it is common thing that he really don't know about our country. so we should give proper guidence to him and forgive him is the correct way of rules."
0,"The offender has not committed any other criminal offenses in the United States (and certainly no dangerous or violent crimes) besides illegal entry, which is a relatively minor infraction. The only punishment should be to deport the individual."
1,"I would like to see him deported.  There are so many instances of illegal citizens being deported who are good, decent human beings and should be allowed to remain here.  If he was deported once, why is he back here?  I would like to see him spend time in our prison system and then be sent back to his legal country!"
1,"I don't think he should be sent to prison, but rather just deported back to his own country.  I don't see the point in sending illegal immigrants to prison period--I don't think it should be seen so much as a """"crime"""" since it's just natural to find another way to enter a country if the country makes it very difficult to enter legally.  Since he's been convicted of a violent crime in the past, I wouldn't really want to just let him free and do nothing, but deporting him seems like a reasonable measure in this case."
1,"HE MUST BE IMPRISONED"
0,"They should give him a fine and the opportunity to file for a legal status in the US. If he does not follow this up and will be caught again then he should be deported."
0,"Illegally entering the country is a crime. The man should be charged with that crime and sent to prison as he committed that crime."
1,"The crime is entering the country illegally. I don't think people should be sent to prison for this. I think prison is overused for crime generally. First I think of this as a moral thing. I don't think it's right to lock people up for this. Second would be more of a monetary argument about the cost of keeping people in prison."
0,"This person should be deported and sent back to where they came from. However, they should not be detained for a long period of time prior to being deported. It should be done quickly and respectfully."
1,"It seems that this person he no problem breaking the law.  And in the future he could case great harm to someone."
1,"I believe he should be deported first. He should not burden the US taxpayers any further. The crime of illegally entering the US is bad, however due to his past he should not be able to reap any benefits of being in the US prison system. "
1,"He should be locked up for illegally entering the country again, after being deported. He has been convicted of violence in the past, to just deport him again would serve no purpose."
0,"I don't think they should be imprisoned - it's a waste of resources. Instead, they should be forced to return to their country and should not be allowed into the US for a period of time, or maybe permanently. "
1,"First off, since he came here illegally, he should either be imprisoned or immediately deported. Second, no one with a violent crime conviction should be allowed into the US legally.  This man should be imprisoned until such time as he can be deported."
1,"I think he should go to prison. He should really be deported, as soon as possible."
1,"I think that they should be convicted because of the two prior convictions. He should be sent back to his original country and be not allowed into the USA."
0,"Just let him go.  We are all people and we do not know his reasons for trying to come here.  He might have a very good reason."
0,"I, think that the man entered the country illegally so he, should be convicted of a crime."
0,"The man broke a law, but that doesn't always equal prison time, even for citizens. There's far from enough information to make a judgment, but the government should compile the information it has and make a plan of action to allow the man to enter the country legally, eventually."
0,"not enough info. dont know circumstances."
0,"I put down Don't Know as the description of the crime does not lend context to the situation. I think he should not be sent to prison if he was lost near the border, which is badly marked in some places, or in some similar situation. I think he should be sent to prison if mal-intent can be proven in some way. "
1,"Deport him to his country, and ask this country to punish him. We should not take care in any circustamce for inmigrant criminals."
1,"This person is a danger to society. He has not learned his lesson and it is clear that he needs to be separated from law abiding citizens. Simply deporting him didn't work in the past."
0,"We should not send a man who has never been imprisoned before for crossing a """"border"""" which is just a man made construct. I believe the only thing the government should do is to require them to apply for citizenship. The worst thing that should occur is them being sent to their home country, not imprisonment. "
0,"he's just trying to improve his life and provide for his family.  Literally all he intends to do is work, which is a good thing"
1,"First, because he illegally tried to enter the United States and because he had already been convicted and served time for a violent offense.  If he's willing to try to get into the US illegally, who's to say that he's not going to commit another violent crime again?  He has the history and he most likely would again.  "
1,"I don't think he should go to prison because he already served his time for his offenses and has been deported. I don't know why he should serve more time."
1,"because a crime was commited previously that resulted in deportation.."
0,"Why would I want to send him to prison here? If anything send him back.  I think we should send you to prison.  How about that?"
0,"He should be sent back to his country. He shouldn't waste our resources."
0,"The person should be deported. The point of immigration law is to benefit the country, spending money to imprison this person is just further waste. Send him home."
0,"He should be deported or fined for illegally entering the USA. Since he has no prior record to have broken the law, a prison sentence might be harsh if he hasn't misused the resources. A way of rectifying this breach of law should be presented to him rather than outright incarceration. "
0,"He should not be sent to jail as he hasn't done anything other than enter illegally. He should be deported, though."
0,"He has no prior offenses so he doesn't deserve to go to jail. I think the US government should allow him to stay in the country."
0,"Should not be sent due to having no prior offenses. Should be fined and be able to stay."
0,"The prison system is already overloaded with real criminals dangerous to society. An illegal should be assessed as to legally applying for US citizenship and processed from there and either deported or accepted in this case."
0,"He has never been in trouble before, he is obviously looking for safety and he should be helped along the road to becoming a citizen."
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison because he had already served his time for his previous crimes.  He should be deported, but not sent to prison.  I don't think anyone should be imprisoned for entering illegally."
1,"This individual appears to have a complete lack of regard for the law and is unable to function in society.  Prison is probably the best place for him so everyone in society can feel safe.  The deportation did not work and prison sounds like the best alternative."
0,"He should be deported and told to come back under the right and lawful ways. If he does not and comes back illegally then he should go to jail."
1,"Given the information so far on the situation, the individual has been violent in the past.  Because of this I think he should be locked up."
0,"The punishment for illegally entering the country is expulsion, not prison. "
0,"he came into the country illeaglly and should pay for his crime"
1,"He should serve a short time in prison for entering into the states illegally. This is because he broke the law. He is 28, an adult and I am sure he is fully responsible for his actions, unlike a child who may have had no choice. "
1,"He should be sent sent to his home country and let them deal with him. It is not fair to the tax payers to pay for his stay in our prison system."
1,"He should serve time in prison since he is in the USA illegally and has had prior offenses. He should serve a minimum of six months for the crime since he is a repeat offender who was previously deported for a violent crime."
0,"Since he is not a criminal, he should not serve jail time. He should face potential deportation instead. "
1,"THE PERSON CAN BE WARNED AND ALLOWED TO STAY IN US"
0,"Since the man did not commit a crime here (other than being here) and has no criminal record, prison time seems inappropriate.  By all means, deport him.  But having him serve time first seems pointless and expensive."
1,"This man had done violent crimes and does  othing but illegal things. He should definitely be sent to pros n for this reason."
0,"The man will likely be deported afterwards, as that is something that would fit the crime. There is no point in making him serve jail time, especially since we will have to pay for it, if he is to be deported anyway."
0,"He should be imprisoned shortly for entering the country illegally since it is against the law. He will hopefully be discouraged from committing a similar crime in the future."
0,"He didn't commit a real crime. He left his country for a reason ."
0,"I think that he should be sent back to his country. Even if he did not do anything else wrong, he still should be sent away for being here illegally. "
1,"I think he should just be deported. I think that's normal protocol."
1,"I think sending him back to his home country is enough. They can decide his legal punishment there. I don't think the U.S. is in any position to imprison a citizen of another country, especially if he didn't commit any violent crimes on American soil."
0,"I think he should be sent to prison because he broke the law by entering the U.S. illegally, and he should be rightfully punished for that. You can't just come into this country without the needed paperwork to do so. It's against the law and it's not fair to people who did things the right way and got what they needed and what was required for them to be able to come here."
1,"This person should be deported. Our prison system already costs taxpayers too much, we should not be paying more to hold an illegal immigrant instead of sending them home."
0,"I do not believe that he should go to prison as he has no prior record and has not committed any crimes. the US government should deport him back to his orginating country but he has not committed any crime in my opinion"
1,"Give warning and send him back to his country."
1,"He is not legal and should not be here unless he is a legal citizen.  He has prior convictions, giving me the idea that he is trouble. "
1,"He should go to jail being illegal because he committed crime in his country and came in illegally."
1,"He committed a crime by entering the country illegally.  He deserves to be punished for what he did."
1,"He has attempted a violent crime and doesn't deserves to be punished, not learning to stop committing crimes."
1,"I would again deport them back to his home country. It may not deter them coming back, but won't be as costly as holding them in prison for a year."
0,"I do not know if , as a first time offender , the man should go to prison. I do , however , think that he should be sent back to his home country if he came here illegally. I think that if he were to come back again (illegally) , he should then be sent to prison. "
0,"Entering the country illegally is breaking the law.  Why should I have to have a drivers license, buy health insurance, and pay taxes if illegal immigrants can get by.  It is not fair.  "
0,"I would send them back to the country of origin.  Imprisoning someone for crossing a countries border seems over the top."
1,"He is guilty of a crime (illegally entering the U.S.).  Given that he has a past violent offense, he should be considered a potential threat to public safety.  He should be sent to prison and deported as he is a potentially violent criminal as per his past history."
0,"He hasn't committed a dangerous crime so he shouldn't be in jail. Just deport him so we don't have to pay for his stay in America."
1,"He should be put in an American prison for awhile, and later, released back into his home country. The United States cannot keep him forever, but they can keep him in prison."
1,"he is a citizen of another country, so he shouldn't even be here.  he has served two prison terms. he has committed a violent crime.  if he shouldn't be in prison, i don't know who should be.  "
0,"It's a non-violent crime with no victims whatsoever. He should either be sent back or be allowed to file for a green card."
0,"I don't think it should be an automatic sentence to prison. I think the person's circumstances should be evaluated on a case by case basis."
0,"I just don't think this is a prison worthy offense. He didn't hurt anyone."
1,"he has not committed another crime here, he should be sent back again, give him 3 strikes"
1,"They should keep him in prison for one year. Then they should physically report him out of the country. This will deter him from coming back."
0,"The man has committed no crime before. He could be a refugee, or may not have known the laws. His story shuld be clarified at least before making a formal decision. "
0,"I believe that the severity of the punishment should fit the crime. Imprisonment does not seem justified based on the fact that the man's only crime was entering the country illegally. In my opinion, what he did was not harmful to others, and therefore he should not be put in prison. I would want to know more about why he entered the country illegally before deciding on punishment. Depending on the reason, I might suggest that he be deported (returned to his home country) or face no punishment at all if, for example, he was fleeing a violent situation."
0,"Being that he is a grown man and entered the country illegally, he should be sent to prison. Even though he never been in prison before doesn't make a difference because he entered the country illegally which is a crime."
1,"He committed a violent crime. He could hurt others in the future if he's not punished."
1,"Given that this person has a history of crime & violence, I feel that he should be deported. If he's to be sent in prison, it should be done in his home country. US citizens shouldn't have to pay for it."
1,"I don't believe that illegally entering a country is worthy of prison time. I think this could open the door to mandatory prison terms for anyone who enters the country illegally and that is unjust to me."
0,"He has not broke any laws, he should not be put in prison. He should be deported, that is the extent of what should be done."
1,"Yes, because having him deported back the first time didn't work. I believe that locking him up would better than just sending him back so lock him up first and after he is done serving his time deport him again."
0,"Jail would end up draining the system, a charge which is often brought against illegal immigration in the first place. This person doesn't seem to pose a risk to my safety. Forcing someone to stay in a country because they entered it illegally is the height of absurdity.  "
0,"I think the government should immediately deport the person since they entered the US illegally. I think there should be no prison time because the person has no prior offense."
1,"This man is a repeat offender and should be treated as such. Either deport him or send him to prison. Does not matter."
0,"illegally stay any person that was very wrong"
0,"I think he should be send back to his country and give the proper steps on how to enter this country legally. What they did was a crime but the punishment shouldn't be jail."
1,"Give him prison time as a deterrent, otherwise he's going to keep coming back, let him know that the only thing here for him is a jail cell.  This is only because he's done time before for committing a violent act, not all undocumented immigrants should be sent to prison."
0,"While I don't think this criminal act warrants being sent to prison, especially since this appears to be the individual's first offense, he should be fined and deported to his home country."
0,"I DON'T THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON.  IF HE WAS PICKED UP AND HE WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG ONLY BEING HERE ILLEGALLY THEN SEND HIM BACK TO HIS LEGAL COUNTRY OR HELP HIM ON A PATH TO BE HERE LEGALLY."
0,"They should be deported, not arrested. It was an illegal action but letting them sit in a jail cell does not solve the problem of them being present in our country. It actually keeps them in the country."
1,"I think probably yes because he had already been deported back to his home country once before. Also, because he has been convicted of a violent crime."
1,"I think that if this person, regardless of whether they are an immigrant or not, should go to prison if they are repeat offenders who have been convicted of violent crimes. It seems that if must have been a pretty serious violent crime that he must have committed to be deported. The fact that he is an immigrant doesn't matter as much as his record."
1,"He should be deported instead of sent to prison. He didn't commit a crime serious enough to be sent to prison."
1,"He has performed no illegal crimes in this country besides illegally entering this country. He should be punished for his crimes but in his own home country. He should be deported instead of jail time."
1,"I do not believe immigration should be granted it a violent crime was committed.  I am a liberal but there should be some limitations on rules to be followed."
0,"The laws in the United States should be upheld. There should be no exceptions. He should be placed in jail and then sent back to his home country."
1,"The U.S. government should send him back to his country. Since hes violent I feel he should not get into the states. He also should not go to prison."
0,"No, not sent to prison, just sent back to his country, but if he reenters then he should be punished. "
1,"This person poses a threat, due to his violent crimes in the past. He cannot claim that his motives were selfless, as he didnt have a wife or (I assume) children."
0,"If the only thing he did wrong was to enter the US illegally, than no, he should not be sent to prison, where he will be among dangerous felons. It was would better to just deport him back to his own country, then tie up our overcrowded legal system. "
1,"He is a violent offender. Clearly deportation wasn't enough to protect others from his return."
0,"If he hasn't committed any other crime, he shouldn't go to jail. He probably came to America for a better life"
0,"The United States should not allow anyone to illegally enter the United States. IF a person wants to enter the United States they must go through the official process of entering the US."
0,"Prisons are full. Incarceration breeds criminality and costs a lot of taxpayer money. There should be a compulsory program that the illegal immigrant should attend at his own expense in order to start a legal route towards a becoming a legal immigrant. If that fails, deportation would follow."
0," It means that instead of him working whatever job he can get, taxpayers pay for him to stay in the country. That seems counter-intuitive. "
0,"This person should not be allowed to stay in the US but not jailed. They did something wrong, but it is not so bad that we should put them in jail here nor is it worth our money to do so."
1,"Because he is a violent criminal in our country illegally the law means nothing to him."
1,"I think he should just be deported to his home country. It would cost taxpayer money to have this person imprisoned."
0,"Regardless of the man having a prior criminal record,  he has committed a crime by illegly entering another country's borders without the proper documentation.  What was stopping him from doing it the right way?  It only takes a little more time and effort to be legit about immigrating. "
0,"I don't think this person should be sent to prison, especially if they have never been imprisoned before. Instead, I think they should be deported to their country of origin."
1,"He should be deported as soon as possible without jail time.  If he entered the US and committed another crime punishable with jail time, so be it.  However, I believe if his current crime was only entering the country illegally then he should just be deported.  He served his time for his previous crimes."
0,"It is a legal offence hence he has to be imprisoned. if he has left like that he might do the mistake once again and think the government is foolish.he has to be warned strictly and inquired why he has entered the country illegally."
0,"His only crime is entering the country illiegaly with no priors, he should get jail time at the most."
0,"I think that the man needs to be proven guilty before he is sentenced to any action. Even then, I think he should be deported to his country of origin to avoid using U.S. prison resources on him if he did enter the country illegally."
1,"Depends. If he served his sentence here there would be no legal reason to hold him. If he did not then he should complete his sentence here. If the crime was committed in another county then he should be returned there."
0,"They should detain this person long enough to document him. After that he should be deported immediately."
0,"I don't believe this should be a criminal offense,  him become a legal citizen "
1,"I'm not sure. I think he should be detained and sent back to his home country unless there are people that are close friends or family of his that live here and want to pay significant money to the U.S. government in order to keep him here."
1,"He should not be sent to prison be a crime he already served his sentence for. Also illegally entering United States should not give a person a prison sentence. He probably came here to start a new life."
1,"ILLEGAL EXPATRIATES LIKE THIS ARE THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY. IT FORMS A RISK TO THE CITIZEN OF PARTICULAR COUNTRY."
0,"He has never committed a crime before. We should not throw people in jail for entering the country"
1,"BEcasue this person is not a good person. Hes broken the law in the past and will continue to do it no matter what. So i feel that he should be locked away to protect the citizens of the united states."
1,"I am basing my decision on the fact that the man committed a violent crime. The man should be deported back to his country of origin and incarcerated."
0,"Why should he be sent to prison? Being locked down like a dog for petty crimes is not good and whoever things otherwise i think it is time for those people to grab some bibles in their hands and learn to be better at heart. Go lock down real criminals , there are plenty of them."
0,"His only crime was entering the US without the proper paperwork. I do not think that warrants a prison sentence."
0,"The person should be imprisoned before being interrogated to check how the person had entered U.S. through which channels, known and unknown, deliberately or unknowingly. This would send a strong message to the offenders."
1,"I think this person should be deported back to his country. The government there can decide what to do with him. Why should we house someone in our jail system that doesn't live here. It would just cost us more money to house someone who is not even a citizen."
1,"He has already been to prison for a violent crime and deported back home.  He doesn't deserve any more chances."
1,"As this was a third offense, this individual should indeed be sentenced to prison. Has this been a first offense, or if this person had not been convicted of a prior crime, my answer may be different. However, given the circumstances in the scenario presented, the best deterrent to keep this individual from committing another violent offense - and to deter others from entering illegally, would be for a longer prison sentence. Following prison this person should be deported directly to his home country."
0,"He shouldn't be sent to prison, he should be deported. Prison time would cost the taxpayers money"
1,"He should be sent to prison because he did something illegal and also has a history of violent crime. If he were to remain free he may commit more crimes."
1,""
0,"I don't think a criminal sentence is justified. Deportation would be enough"
0,"He should be sent to prison because he broke the law in our country. We send first time offenders to jail or prison every day in America. The man should be punished and then deported."
0,"Well, he committed a crime, but there was no direct harm to anyone, so I don't think imprisonment is appropriate. I think he should be interviewed, and if he has skills that are a benefit to the USA allowed to stay, otherwise sent back to his country of origin."
1,"Did he commit a crime in the US? Should he just be sent back? I'd need to know more about the case."
0,"In this particular case, deportation would probably be a severe enough punishment, as long as he is not a repeat offender.  "
1,"This individual entered the United States illegally so they are a criminal for just that alone. This individual is a danger to the public considering they have already been in prison twice already. They need to be put in prison."
0,"In principle he's not supposed to be in the country and should be deported.  In practice, the country would probably be better off not spending money to imprison and deport him."
0,"Our prisons are full enough as it is; as he has committed no violent crime, he should not go to prison. At the least, he should be fined and put on a path to legal citizenship. At the most, he should be deported out of the country."
0,"He hasn't committed any dangerous crimes, nor harmed anyone so far. His background should be reviewed and he should be given the opportunity to become a citizen if cleared. "
0,"This 28 year old man shouldn't be sent to prison because simply put wanting a better life should not be considered a crime in the US. We were founded on that precise concept. The US government in this case shouldn't take any negative actions, but positive ones that could include assisting this individual in becoming a citizen."
1,"The man has already served his time for his offenses and paid the penalty.  If you want to deport the man for illegally entering the US, that's fine, but there's no reason for the man to be sent to prison."
1,"I think that people who have committed crimes and are here illegally give hardworking immigrants (especially those without documentation) a bad name. I think that those who work hard and add to the community should be able to stay. The person above should be punished and should be returned to his country of origin."
0,"There are more circumstances that should be considered. I would like to know why he did it illegally and his reason for coming to the U.S in the first place before deciding whether or not he should be imprisoned."
1,"He broke the law. He entered the US illegally which is against the law and should be punished. Not only should he go to jail, he should be deported immediately upon his release from prison. His sentence should be based upon the existing laws in the US. Since he was previously deported and returned again, his sentence should be stiffer than for a first time offender."
0,"Except for getting into US, he has not committed any crime which should be taken into consideration. He must be poor if he entered illegally so if possible, he should be either given a job in the United States or sent to his own country."
0,"He did nothing inherently dangerous to himself or another person, nor does he show a potential for such danger. While he obviously cannot just live in the country without going through proper procedures, he should not be detained for trying to seek a better life."
1,"Entering the U.S. illegally is and of itself a serious crime that should be punished, and he also has serious priors.  He has a proven track record of low character, bad intentions, and total disregard and respect for the law.  He should be imprisoned and deported."
1,"I feel that any immigrant that serves or commits a severe crime should be in prison and most definitely get immigrated back to their country there is no reason why to spend American tax dollars on immigrants that are going to go to jail"
0,"The U.s government should not take any actions. At the very worse they should just send him back to his original country. Or at least gave him a chance in the U.S."
1,"I do not think entering the United States without documentation should be a crime. As a result, I think the US government should only be concerned about this individual's status if there are outstanding warrants for other criminal activities. I believe the US government should allow this individual to enter the country unmolested."
0,"Even though I don't believe it should be illegal he did do something that is illegal. No one is above the same laws we hold everyone else to."
1,"I don't think prison is appropriate for illegal entry into a country. Deportation sounds like it was probably appropriate in this case, but I do not believe prison would be. After all, his violent crime as in his past and he already served time for it. Illegal entry itself is a nonviolent and relatively minor offense and should be dealt with appropriately."
0,"He should be offered a chance to present his reasons for entering the country and what his intentions are. He should be provided with the opportunity to become a legal resident but if he decides not to or commits any felonious crime he should be deported."
0,"The person holds an illegal status in the United States. To be fair to everyone and to support the status of legal citizens in the country, those people holding illegal status should be punished. Serving time in prison is one such punishment our country should apply."
1,"In the United States, citizens are usually given longer sentences for consecutive offenses, whether they are similar or not. This person was not only first here illegally but has served prior sentences in prison. This person has previously committed a VIOLENT crime, let alone a crime in general, and I would not be willing to give them more chances than they have been given. "
1,"He should not go to prison. He should be able to be able to legally fill out whatever paperwork he needs to and stay. He spent time in prison in his country, maybe because of the deadly circumstances. "
1,"He is a violent offender, so the government should detain him. After detaining him, he should be deported. "
1,"(1) He should be deported back to his own country. (He does not belong in the US)
(2) If he is caught re-entering the country, he should be incarcerated for at least 10 years. (punishment for repeated illegal entry)"
1,"If the only crime was entering the US illegally then he should be deported and sent back .If he has already served time for his previous crimes then it should not include more prison time."
0,"I think that the lawbreaker should be immediately deported. If he should appear once again in the U.S. he should be immediately imprisoned at hard labor for one year and deported again after release with the understanding that should he re-enter the U.S. he will be executed."
0,"because that's too harsh a sentence for that. He should be allowed to stay."
1,"Yes, because he already has a criminal record. His criminal record included a violent crime."
1,"For one, it is against the law to enter a country illegally. Secondly, he needs to be used as an example so that no one else will enter the country illegally."
0,"He shouldn't go to prison because he didn't commit a violent crime and is clearly not a criminal. He should however be required to return to his own country."
0,"This man is 26 years old, while this is young, he should have a since of personal responsibility.  A since of personal responsibility would have led him to at least already be in the process of becoming a citizen.  These laws are in place for a reason. "
0,"The individual should be deported instead. He should be allowed to re-enter once he does so legally."
0,"This person was not a criminal, he came here for a better life. The US Governement should find out his reasonings for being here. If he has family here, then he should be allowed to be with his family. If he was coming here for dirty dealings then he should be deported as soon as possible. I don't believe putting people in prison is the answer."
1,"Since he is an habitual offender he should be put in the jail. More so he should be deported back to his home country. US law should be more stringent against such immigrants."
0,"I do not believe that this offender should be imprisoned because he has not been imprisoned before and likely does not pose any threat to this country. He should simply be removed from the U.S. and sent back to the country that he is a citizen of."
1,"THESE KIND OF MENS AND WOMES WERE SHOULD NOT ALLOWED TO ENTIRING COUNTRY TO AVOID UNOFFICAL THING TO COUNTRY"
1,"The person should be sent back to his home country. If the violent crime he committed happened in his original country, he needs to be disciplined in that country. "
0,"He should be sent to prison because he broke the law. That is the only way we can deter people from entering the country illegally. If we just always send them back we no negative actions then there is no reason for them not to try again."
1,"First of all he is an undocumented immigrant in this country. He also has two prior charges that would consider him """"dangerous"""". For this i think he should serve a minimum of 2 years in prison."
0,"You have to evaluate the reasons and not judge it so hard"
1,"Because the man  is a citizen of another country. that is not main matter. illegaly entered the united states this is main mistake. so that man is lock to prison"
1,"A person who has formally been convicted of a crime shouldn't be allowed residency. That they seem to be capable of committing additional offenses is also worrying."
1,"I think he should be sentenced to prison based on his actions.  They illegally came into the US and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."
0,"If this person's only crime is that he illegally entered the US it doesn't make sense to put him in a US prison.  That doesn't solve any problems and instead ruins a man's life and may actually turn him into a criminal.  There are two options, if he has a job or relatives in the US, a place to live, is able to support himself  then have him complete paperwork to be here legally.  If he has no job, no family, no place to live I would deport him and advise him to apply to return legally."
1,"For one thing, he is not here legally.  I don't have patience for that.  The fact that he has already proven himself untrustworthy by committing a violent crime make it worse.  He needs to be locked up for a long time."
1,"He should be sent back to where he came from. Send him to prison until he can be deported."
0,"If he has not been convicted of any other crimes, the worst that should happen is he should just be deported. There is no need for the US to spend money jailing people who merely entered our borders illegally."
0,"He should not be arrested. America is supposed to be the place for people with dreams, and now we are severly punishing those trying to fulfill their dreams? The government needs to create a better process for legal immigration."
1,"I think they should be as they are here illegally.  They should not be here at all."
1,"He is a repeat offender. Plus, he also broke the law."
0,"They should find out why he tried to enter the country illegally.  Depending on his answers and how truthful he is, they should either send him back to the country of origin, or help he come to the US legally."
0,"He is a first time offender. I do not believe prison matches the crime or serves the interest of the United States. Why pay for his incarceration when he can simply be sent back home. It wouldn't fit the crime he has committed. in my opinion at least."
1,"I feel like he should be sent back to prison because he is a repeat offender. I also think the fact that he had a violent crime should be taken into account."
0,"He doesn't appear to be a criminal in general. If the only crime is illegal immigration, they should be sent back or have a tracker and allowed to temporarily remain if an immigration hearing is warranted."
0,"United states was built of immigration. He should be deported but not imprisioned ."
0,"We shouldn't send non violent offenders to prison. This man can be deported, at the most."
0,"i dont think that they should be put in prison i think that there should be ways of filling to become a citizen"
0,"The individual did not physically harm another nor deprive them of their life or property. Incarceration would likely cost more than the cost of letting the individual go. I think such a person should be registered and placed on a probation like system where they must gain employment within 4 months and must maintain employment for 3 years. They must also have proof of residency and pay taxes. They cannot send money out of the country during this period of time. If they do not have any criminal offenses during this time they can then take the nationalization test to try and become a citizen."
0,"According to me, immigration to other country is ok but in illegal way is not accepted. "
0,"The person should not be put into jail since he did not commit a crime that hurt anyone. If anything he should be held in custody and asked why he entered illegally. After questioning he should be informed about the legal ways to go about entering the country then be sent back home."
1,"He has a violent background. If he was deported once already for his crime, he seems to be a dangerous person that shouldn't be free. "
0,"I don't think he should be imprisoned. However since he is in this country illegally he should be deported."
1,"The way the court system works for a conviction more than letting people go, there is not enough information here to make that call."
1,"This person is a career criminal. Having been previously convicted of a violent crime and deported. He should go to prison as he learned nothing from previous convictions."
1,"This man has previously committed a violent crime. He clearly did not rehabilitate after serving two sentences."
1,"He is breaking the law. He is a dangerous criminal. I think the government needs to be careful."
1,"He should be deported immediately. Putting him in jail here just allows him to take advantage of the better treatment he will receive here and might lead to his remaining here after his release."
1,"He's taking up time and resources needed to document the crimes he has committed. And he's a confirmed repeat offender. Leniency shouldn't be recommended in this case."
0,"I think he doesn't deserve to be imprisoned if his intentions were good. If he was entering to cause terror, then different actions must be taken."
1,"I don't know. He already went to prision, why he is out of prision, why he should be in prision again?"
1,"Immigration should never be a crime. Even if he has a past record, he should be allowed to freely enter and exit the country as he pleases. Abolish all countries! Destroy all borders! Down with all nations!"
0,"getting into a country without immigration is not a crime , he has no other option and looking for a place to live because of the bad situation happening in his country"
1,"This person is a criminal who has committed at least two prior offenses, one of them a violent crime. As such, he can be considered  to be still a clear and present danger to society. In addition, he entered the US illegally and was caught and convicted. The offender should be sent to send to prison."
0,"I know it''s a crime to come here but I don't think a person without a criminal record should be arrested just send him/her right back."
0,"I think a better solution to sending him to prison and housing and feeding this person is to just send them home and ban them from the USA."
1,"I believe that he should be put in prison for illegally entering the US in his own country.  We do not have the room, nor the means to support another prisoner."
0,"The government shouldn't imprison him, but should evaluate his contributions. If staying in the US benefits the greater good, find a path to citizenship with some kind of penalty; if it doesn't, deport him."
1,"The individual has committed a violent crime in our country; therefore, he should be imprisoned for violating his deportation and coming back to this country."
1,"No, he should not be sent to prison in this country but sent back to his own country and face justice there. He should also be monitored as to not be allowed to enter this country again."
1,"The offender should pay for his crime. He should not get a free pass but running away from it."

1,"government must take care about the illegal immigrants very carefully, because the terrorism may happen if they allow illegal immigrant"
0,"Why waste tax payer money on sending him to prison?  Just deport him since he is not here legally.  Paying a fine and deporting would be a better option."
1,"He's already proven more than once that he has no desire to respect the laws of this country.  Why should our citizens be put at risk to let him keep breaking the law??"
1,"This person should receive their due punishment for the crime they committed with jail time. Also, since they came to the country illegally, they should be deported after serving their prison time."
0,"He is a citizen of another country.  He should be returned to his country of origin.  I don't think that imprisonment serves any sort of tangible deterrent effect either.  If it did, I would reconsider."
0,"He should be deported but it's not necessary to imprison him. It's a waste of resources."
0,"He has not committed any other crimes. He should be sent back to his country, if he does it again than jail would be fitting."
1,""
0,"I don't think this man should be imprisoned in the United States. I think he should be deported back to his home country. I think this man serving time in prison is a financial burden on the US."
1,"The person needs to spend time in prison because he's a multiple offender. He is violent and needs to feel more hesitancy by being punished rather than get a slap on the wrist."
0,"This person has not committed any crimes severe enough to warrant being removed from society.  He is not a danger to anybody around him, so prison will serve no purpose.  I believe that a fine is the harshest punishment that this man deserves for this crime."
0,"I'm not sure prison is the right or wrong answer, but instead of prison maybe they should be deported.  There needs to be some sort of punishment, I don't think people should go unpunished for breaking laws/rules.  "
0,"I don't think he has done anything worthy of jail. He is just trying to find a better life."
0,"The man should be identified, processed, and deported.  He entered the United States illegally and completely bypassed the system set in place that more deserving people have gone through and are going through."
1,"I don't know because I'm not familiar with the sentencing laws for illegally entering the united states. If this were a first offense I would say no, if that's consistent with the law, but in this case I'm leaning toward yes because he is a repeat offender and breaks other laws while he's at it. "
1,"These people need to quit coming to our country. It is already overpopulated here and they are diluting American culture."
0,"The man should be sent free-of-charge back to his country of origin.  The countries resources should not be used on processing & imprisoning him."
1,"HE TRY BEFORE, HE NEED TO GO TO JAIL , it will let him know he is not welcome there is a process to come into this country. he broke the law "
0,"If they've illegally entered the country then they should be sent back to their country of origin. Throwing them in prison would just keep them here and would take up space/tax dollars that could be used for locking up violent criminals."
0,"The person certainly does act against the law...but it is not a serious crime that demands the offender to go to prison. The government should deport the person and put her/his personal data in a data base (and eventually restrict future entry to the US)."
1,"Prison overcrowding is a major problem in the United States, and those in prison cost the tax payers of this country a great deal of money.  This offender should be deported instead of being incarcerated. "
1,"He should serve time because he is a repeat offender. He has committed previous violent acts, as well as breaking the law by entering the country. Alternatively, he should just be deported."
0,"he broke the law, sending him to prison will allow ICE to locate him easily for deportation"
0,"I don't believe that is a conviction worth of illegally entering another country. I believe the person should just sent back to their country."
1,"He has already been to prison twice he is a repeat offender I don't see any reason why he shouldn't go to prison this time he has had more than one chance and he keeps repeat offending that is what prison is for."
1,"He committed a crime. He should be sent back to his country to serve time."
0,"By prison I, of course, mean the prison of the country he was trying to escape from. Not any actual prison. He cannot be allowed here anymore. We have a new sheriff in town - Donald J. Trump! Yes!!"
1,"He should be deported again. Prison for third offense."
1,"This person is constantly breaking the laws. He should be sent to prison or transferred to the prison of his country. The nature of his crimes which have included violence leads me to believe he is not someone who should be allowed to stay in the United States."
0,"He should be detained and deported with the warning that if he comes in illegally again he will be imprisoned."
1,"He is not criminal. He is other country citizen."
1,"Because this person has repeatedly committed crimes he can not be trusted to avoid doing so in the future. He should be jailed and then deported to punish him and show others with criminal records that they should not try to enter the US."
0,"I don't think prison is called for in the offense. I would need to know why he entered illegally. At worst he should be deported back to his home country."
1,"I feel that he should be put in prison to see if he will change if not than he would better off than walking the streets and causing more crime , I feel if he has done it once he will do it again "
1,"I not sure if he should be sent to prison or not. It would depend on what his previous violent crime was and how long ago. It would also depend on if he was on arrested for being and Illegal alien or if he had also committed a crime here while he was an Illegal alien. So there are alot of things to conisider. I dont feel that just being here Illegally should require a prison sentence that seems a little harsh especially since the only people who really arent immigrants in this country are the native americans"
0,"I DON'T LIKE THIS ACTIVITIES"
0,"I do not think prison time has any use here for a one time offender. No what else should be done is another matter all together. I think a decision has to made by the government at this time if he will be allowed to work towards citizenship or not, if not hen he should be sent away."
0,"The immigrant should be deported and prohibited from re-entering for a time frame, but prison is not proportional for the crime. If it was, the people hiring illegal immigrants should go to prison for a time period that reflects the number of illegal immigrants that they enabled. i.e. If the owner of a farm or business knowingly employed 100 immigrants for 1 year, the appropriate punishment should be 100 years if the illegal immigrant is given 1 year in prison."
0,"At this point in time, I think it's time we crack down on illegal immigration. There are plenty of immigrants that come into this country legally, we don't need to worry about taking care of immigrants who come into this country illegally. I feel that if they come in illegally, they should be sent back to their country after their arrest."
0,"I DO NOT BELIEVE THE MAN SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON SIMPLY FOR WANTING THE AMERICAN DREAM. I THINK THAT THE MAN SHOULD BE RETURNED TO HIS HOME COUNTRY AND HE SHOULD BEGIN TRYING TO GAIN CITIZENSHIP THE LEGAL WAY."
1,"He has a known criminal history.  He had been deported previosly and had illegally returned."
1,"This person has committed a violent crime and has shown that he is likely to re-enter the country illegally if deported. It is the duty of government to protect society by imprisoning person such as this."
0,"It may be necessary to detain him temporarily in order to ascertain whether or not he is a threat to American citizens. For example, if he is an escaped prisoner from his home country or on the run for having committed a crime, but beyond that, I don't think jailing an illegal immigrant would be the best use of our resources. The problem is, once you've detained him, he still has legal rights and then there would be a convoluted process of holding him in prison and then released him to be deported once again. I believe it would be better to forgo the jailing process and to either give him a means to citizenship or simply deport him immediately."
0,"Humans should not be considered illegal just for existing. If he didn't break any laws against other people, he should be allowed to live here and work for a better life and work towards citizenship."
1,"Maybe this person should be sent back to their country to be judged there"
1,"he should be sent home for that. he did his time and should have more added"
0,"I don't think it should be illegal to cross a border. I also don't think a first offense for a non-violent crime like this should result in prison time."
1,"He was deported back and served his jail sentence. He is an ex-felon, but served his time.  I don't think crossing a border illegally on its own should carry a jail sentence."
1,"I can see the three strikes and you're out rule, but I am not sure if that is 3 felonies or if it is 3 violent crimes. So, I don't know what is the law in this case."
0,"That is not worthy of prison time.  Does not solve the problem.  Total wast of resources and harms someone that could help out."
1,"This person should not be kept in jail but deported again to his home country and not allowed to enter the United States again. A person should not be able to stay in a United States jail for breaking into the country."
1,"He broke the law multiple times. Law breakers go to jail. That is the law."
0,"He's likely Hispanic and thus should be deported. And his life should be ruined."
0,"The U.S. government should provide a hearing on this individual's case in which it evaluates the potential legitimacy of the undocumented individual's claims to residency. It should then make a decision regarding either adjusting their immigration status or deportation."
1,"No, they should just be deported. We don't need to clutter up our prisons with illegal immigrants. "
1,"I think that he should be deported. He has spent time already in prison here. He needs to go back home."
1,"I feel that if he already served his time back home, he should only be deported from the U.S. I think if the man committed more crimes while in the U.S., then he should be sent to prison."
1,"He should just be sent back home."
0,""
0,"He should go to Priscilla n because he entered the country illegally. There is a proper way to citizenship and there needs to be consequences for those who break the law."
1,"This person should be taken into custody immediately.  Plans should be made to deport them back to the country of origin.  This person is known to have violent, criminal tendencies. "
0,"If you don't do this people will be more encouraged to enter illegally. I think it needs to be done though the punishment should probably be being deported."
1,""
1,"He should be in prison mainly because he is a repeat offender. While he may have felt the need to try to re-enter the US, he knew the ramifications of being caught. A combination of that and the fact that he has been convicted of a crime prior to this serves as a justified reason to imprison the individual."
0,"I think he has never commited a crime something as severe as jail time would be devastating to his life. I think there should be programs for immigrants explaining why they can't enter illegally"
0,"He should be fingerprinted, photographed, and any identifying marks made known. Then he should be deported back to his country. He should be told that if he enters the United States illegally again he will be sent to the worst prison in the country for a mandatory 20 years."
0,"Putting the man in prison is a waste of resources and just adds to our overwhelming prison population. The man should receive help on how to legally become an American citizen or be safely deported back to his hometown in Mexico."
0,"The fact of entering a country is not crime enough to send someone to prison. What the US government should do depends upon the circumstances of the man's actions. If the man entered the US """"illegally"""" many years ago when he was a teen, then the US should help the man gain citizenship. If the man entered the US last week, he should be deported back to his country of origin if it would not endanger his safety to do so."
0,"He should be sent to prison, at least few months, he's done something illegal, otherwise many could do the same."
1,"This man should go to prison because he is guilty of entering the country illegally. He was also in prison before and deported so he is a repeat offender. After he serves his time he should be deported because he is illegal and isn't supposed to be here in the first place according to the law."
1,"I think he should be deported back to his country. He has already served his due time for previous offenses. I do not think entering the US illegally is an arrestable offense therefore we just have to send him back to his nation."
0,"Because he disobeyed law of the land. He should be given a fair trial and put behind bars if proved he is an offender."
0,"I think that it would be wrong to send him to prison and have tax payers pay for his food, etc...  He should be deported immediately.  He didn't something wrong, should be removed from our country, and should be allowed to reenter the U.S. in a legal way."
1,"He is a violent offender.  He shouldn't be allowed to come here and commit more crimes."
1,"Because One of these previous sentences was for a violent crime and he had been deported back to his home country. so he deported to his country and may they recommend the punishment"
1,"He needs to be sent to prison.  He needs to be there a long time and then deported back to his country."
0,"The man crossed a border, which isn't a serious offence by itself. Jail time would not have any effect on him. He should pay a fine instead. "
1,"Yes, he should be sent to prison because he violated the law. He illegally entered the United States and has already served two previous sentences. Most likely, he knows this is illegal, yet, he still committed a crime and should pay the price."
0,"I do not think that a person never convicted of a crime should be sent to jail in this instance. If they were a prior offender maybe but they need to be deported."
0,"Certain crimes are prison worthy (traditionally most felonies), other crimes its not worth ruining someones life by putting them in prison just because they were disobedient to established law.

Put him in a deportation center and deport him back to his original country."
1,"They should be sent back to their own country."
0,"This person did not do anything that harmed anyone. He should be deported. Incarcerating him would do no good to anyone."
1,"He should serve time in jail because he has prior violent offenses. He tried to enter the country after being deported for a violent crime."
1,"Because he was a person with a violent background"
0,"He should not be imprisoned. He should be sent out of the country for entering illegally."
1,"This man is not a citizen of the US, so I think that he should be deported to his country and be sent to prison to serve another sentence. So, I don't believe that this man should serve time in a US prison, but should definitely serve time back in his home country. "
1,"I'm all about the """"three strikes you're out"""" mindset.  I believe he will commit another crime down the road based on his past history, and I find the violent crime more than just concerning.  Clearly, deportation isn't working in this case, he just came back in.  I have to be real honest here - his illegal re-entry bothers me WAY less than the criminal record he is building up.  But, if this gets him off the street, then so be it."
0,"I do not think this man should be sent to prison. I think the government should try to keep track of such people, but not send a person to prison for only crossing the border. "
1,"Because they are criminals. They have broke the law. American cirizens must be protected from them."
1,"I think the man should just be sent back to his home country. The U.S. shouldn't have to pay to house him in our U.S. prison for illegally entering the country."
1,"I don't know if the offender should be sent to prison. I don't think they should just based on the crime of being in the US illegally."
0,"It wouldn't make sense to keep him in the country if his crime was coming into the country illegally. He should be deported back to where he came from."
1,"I think he should be deported not imprisoned"
0,"I think the individual should be deported and told if he enters the U.S. again illegally, he will be prosecuted.  An alternative would be to give him 90 days to file for legal citizenship to some degree."
0,"I think it depends on what country he came from, and why he entered the US illegally.  If he's a refugee that was no longer safe waiting for the US to approve his arrival and is requesting citizenship, it's quite a different case than if he had never bothered to try entering legally, just came because he wanted to make money, and was planning on staying here illegally without ever becoming a citizen.  The government should find out more of the reasons why this man entered illegally and then base the punishment on that."
1,"This person, rather than being sent to prison, should be deported immediately out of the US and back into his own country. I base this on simply that he entered the US illegally, not necessarily his other crimes. The government should deport him, and we as citizens should not be required to house him in jail providing free food and lodgings for him. "
0,"He shouldnt be sent to prison, he should be deported. Being sent to prison would mean our tax dollars going to his care. If he's deported, he's not our problem."
0,"The gravity of the crime is not against humanity, he did not kill or harm another human being. His previous record would suggest he is of good standing. Worst case scenario, the government may deport him back home. "
0,"He should merely be deported to his home country. No point in wasting money on imprisonment."
1,"He should be sent to jail for entering the US illegally. I also believe that violent offender immigrants should not be sent into the USA."
1,"I don't know if it's a good idea to sent a person to prison in a country he entered illegally.  Deporting him back home would be a better option."
1,"He is a dangerous person with a history of violence. We could deport him again, but more than likely he will just try to sneak back in again. Prison is of course a last option due to the cost involved, but it seems necessary unless his origin country has some proposal on how to deal with him."
1,"I don't think someone who has been committed of a violent crime should be allowed entry into the U.S.  If they have already done wrong elsewhere, they should not come here and do the same to people who live and travel here.  The government should absolutely detain him."
1,"The offender should be sent to prison based on previous history. The government should heavily review their case though."
0,"I believe that if one enters the country and does not go through all of the proper steps, to ensure of the safety of the citizens then these measure should be taken. If one wants to enter the country then it should be done legally. "
0,"I think he should be deported but not sent to prison. I don't believe they are full fledged criminals with ill intent."
1,"He should be deported again, and possibly transferred to a prison in his home country. It's not worth paying for someone to be in our prisons that doesn't contribute to our society in the first place. "
1,"No. We do not need to use tax dollars to house illegal immigrants. Criminals should be deported as soon as possible."
1,"This man has been arrested twice before. He is a repeat offender and should be looked up."
1,"US law is based on the moral principles of degree of wrong, culpability and extent of repeated criminal activity.  This man has been previously convicted of a violent crime and previously deported. He is a repeating criminal."
0,"The person should either be deported or made to pay a fine. Sending them to prison is burdensome on the state and serves no purpose because what they did was exceedingly minor. I'm strongly opposed to deporting them but that makes more sense than jailing them."
0,"Coming here without going through the right channels is illegal. By not punishing him, you are telling others that this is okay."
0,"Our prison system is overcrowded. We already use it too much for minor offenses. This is probably the most minor offense possible. There are no victims at all. The government should provide the person with a viable path to citizenship. The government should also educate this person so that he becomes an informed citizen."
0,"Prisons are over crowded now as it is, if we imprisoned every one who entered the country illegally it would only make matters worse and use more money for food and board to house them."
0,"Someone who is illegally entering the United States could be doing so for a number of reasons; one of which being they want to live here instead of wherever they came from. And it isn't a matter of simply becoming a citizen; because that could take years to do. Depending on the person's demeanor, intentions, and possible family, they should be offered a chance at becoming a citizen."
1,"I don't think we should spend money having him in our prison. He should be sent back to his home country at once. The US government should ban him from entering the country again."
1,"This particular man--who is already a convicted felon in the U.S.--should be sent to prison for entering (or re-entering) this country illegally. BUT he should only return to prison to be held there until he is deported again. Sadly, the odds are high he'll find a way to return, illegally."
1,"The violent crime is the most important factor here. This person is violent and is repeatedly entering the system."
1,"I think that If a person breaks a law established by a country they must be punished as set forth by that country.  I dont think the previous criminal history should necessarily matter if he already completed the terms of those crimes."
0,"US government should deport him to his original country. Immigrants should follow the approved process to enter the US."
1,"Rather than sending the man to prison, he should be deported to his own country again. While he may try to sneak back into the country, there is a chance he won't succeed. If he is sent to prison, tax payers will be forced to pay for his care. The prisons are already too crowded. Anyone who has prior prison sentences and is convicted of entering the country illegally should be deported."
1,"Yes, because this person has broken the law several times. They have come into the country illegally to probably try and avoid getting caught in their own country! They should be deported back to their own country and sent to prison."
0,"I generally do not approve of imprisoning non-violent offenders. I also am kind of against nations in the sense we have them now, so immigration is a non-issue in my perspective."
0,"No real crime committed in my opinion.  The man should be given an opportunity to legally become a citizen.  If they are not able or willing then they should be sent home.  They are more then likely trying to make a better life for themselves and should be given a chance."
1,"I would prefer he be deported. Our country should not have to for his care. If we could I would really prefer 5 years hard labor as deterrent."
1,"He should be deported for illegally entering the country. He may have served two sentences but his crimes are not for the US to jail him for. We also don't need to waste resources jailing people who don't legally belong in the country."
1,"He is a habitual offender and he needs to know the consequences of entering our country illegally. He needs to spend five years in prison and know that next time it will be ten."
1,"He should be sent to prison because he violated the law of the united states. He should be sent to prison to serve his sentence."
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison.  Prisons are already overcrowded.  He should be deported and held in a county jail or Immigration Department detainment center until he is deported."
0,"Bottom line, he entered illegally.  There would have been ways for him to enter legally, and go through the proper channels.  But based on the fact that he didn't follow these rules, he broke the law, and therefore, should go to prison.  Once in prison, he can be investigated more, if he looks like he wasn't planning any harm, he can then try to go through the proper channels to enter legally.  If he is found that he was involved in something more, he should be held and charged. "
1,"He has already been deported once so should be deported again.  We should not incur the cost of holding him in prison especially if his only crime this time is of illegal entry."
0,"Since this person has never had a prioe record of offenses, he should not be sent to prison. However since he was convicted of illegally entering the country he should be depoted because he violated US law."
0,"Assuming he did nothing else, and was unaware of how to legally get into the US."
1,"If he has a prior record, he should go to prison. The fact that he had been deported before for a violent crime meant that he was banned from the country. "
0,"Besides the fact that I don't think there should be such a thing as 'illegal' immigration, I think the nation would be better served in naturalizing people instead of putting them in prison or expending resources on sending them back to wherever they came from. It doesn't make sense, either economically or morally, to do so. "
1,"He is a repeat offender and has committed violent crime. He was deported due to violent crime and previous infractions."
0,"I think he should be deported if he is not claiming asylum. I don't think he should go to prison and if there are extenuating circumstances (like family or business ties here) he should be allowed some time to take care of his affairs."
0,"I don't know if being sent to prison is the appropriate response? Nor do I feel like it's an appropriate use of resource."
0,"this man does not have a criminal record , hes only enter illegally to another country its a crime, but not a violent one."
0,"The individual should not be imprisoned.  The individual should be allowed to consult an immigration attorney to determine if he qualifies for asylum."
0,"He should not be sent to prison, however, he should be sent to a holding facility which will contain him until his deportation process can be fulfilled. Upon staying at the holding facility, he needs to be briefed and given every means necessary to learn how to legally try to reenter as a legal immigrant. "
0,"He should be returned to his country if not dangerous and banned from the US for 5 years.  He could then apply to enter."
0,"he should be deported and all US assets seized. Jailing means we lose more on him to pay for holding him"
0,"On one hand, he should be punished for breaking the law. On the other hand, I feel like he should be deported rather than having taxpayers pay for his stay in prison. "
0,"I feel that this man should be given a class on how to legally enter the United States and then he should be given instructions on to a path to citizenship.  This man should be allowed to enjoy America as millions of immigrants have done before him. In no way do I feel he should be stuck into prision for trying to better his life and perhaps the lives of his family members."
0,"Many people want to go to the US in search of the """"American Dream."""" This man entered illegally but did not have any previous convictions. There should definitely be a reprimand involved for entering illegally, but it should not be as extreme as going to prison. The government should send him back to his country, or maybe find out why he had to enter the US illegally in the first place and from there, create a solution. "
0,"Why use our tax dollars to imprison an illegal immigrant. The best thing to do would be to deport him."
1,"I would say that he should go to prison because he is a repeat offender. He should serve a short prison term, and then be sent back to his home country again."
1,"here his crime has proved by govt.   so has to put in prison, after punishment he has to go back to his country"
1,"THESE KIND OF MENS/WOMENS WERE SHOULD NOT ALLOWED TO ENTERING COUNTRY. TO AVOID UNOFFICIAL THINGS IN COUNTRY."
1,"He's illegal entered the country before and is a violent person.  He needs to do prison time and then be deported back again."
0,"I do not believe that the person should be sent to prison due to the fact that they are not a risk to society and may have been attempting to enter this company for a better life. I believe that they should be deported however given circumstances. If they have sustained a job and have provided for the country then I do not think that they should be deported, but I believe that another punishment should be given."
1,"He is a repeat offender. High recidivism rate. He has committed violent crimes. If he's out, he's pretty likely to do it again, and some innocent person doesn't deserve that"
1,"Because it is against the law to come illegally."
0,"The offender should not be sent to prison and instead should be deported back to his country. He shouldn't go to prison because he had no prior convictions and putting him in prison would cause prison overcrowding and be more costly than deportation."
1,""
1,"I think the US government should deport him.  I don't think it should be their job or concern to jail him for illegally entering.  Had he committed a crime after illegally entering the US I would say yes he should be imprisoned"
1,"He has already been deported once, and is a convicted felon.  A two-year sentence would serve as a deterrent to other felons attempting to enter the country illegally."
0,"They came to this country illegally but jail time isn't needed. They don't need to learn a lesson. They could be sent back to their country with the knowledge on how to come here legally."
1,"I think he deserves to go to prison because he knew he was breaking the law. He didn't just break the law once, it's something he does repeatedly and so he should be punished. If they don't do anything, the likelihood of him breaking even more laws is high."
0,"He should be deported, rather than allowed to stay in prison at our expense. If he returns, he could be sent to prison."
1,"The person should be deported back to his home country because he came here illegally. The person should also get some jail time for repeat offenses because it shows that he clearly hasn't changed his ways."
0,"We have laws set in place. It's unfair to other immigrants that followed the correct way to enter."
0,"Yes, just like every other american in the country if you commit a crime you go to prison. "
1,"Sending this man to prison costs tax payer money with nothing in return.  Either deport the man or do nothing."
1,"This is a violent criminal who is committing an immigration offense. Not all immigrants are equal. If immigration is the only crime someone has committed, it is worth evaluating their situation in more detail - however, if they have a criminal record in our nation, or at large, it is worth sending them to prison."
0,"he should be charged with a misdemeanor and be sentenced with time served and deported. prison is meant for felonies--and in this case, that would be overkill."
1,"He should just be deported immediately and not allowed to remain and reenter the US. There is no reason to spend tax dollars housing him if the only offense at this time is entering the country illegally."
0,"Entering the country illegally shouldn't carry a prison sentence. He might be educated on how to properly become a citizen or at the extreme be deported, but there seems no point in prison."
0,"He should merely be processed back to the country he came from. To the exent possible, he should also have to pay for his transportation homee."
0,"Since this was the man's first offense and he's never been imprisoned before, I believe he should just be deported back to his prior country.   "
1,"The man should definitely be deported back to his home country, but I am unsure if he should be jailed for illegally entering. It would depend on what his previous crimes had been - were they actually morally reprehensible crimes or crimes of being poor (i.e. driving without a valid license) that immigrants may commit to survive as they are trying to establish themselves in a new country?"
0,"They should not be sent to prison.  They should be put on a probationary term in which they are given a certain amount of time to either obtain citizenship or leave this country.  They should also be actually given the tools and the chance to obtain that citizenship and should not have to have any obstacles in their way, ie too much money, paperwork takes too long, no classes available, etc."
1,"SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON.  SHOULD ALSO BE DEPORTED AFTER SENETENCE HAS BEEN SERVED."
1,"Despite his past crimes, the man only crossed a national border.  I do not believe that the crime of entering the United States illegally should be responded to with a prison sentence."
1,"This person has illegally entered twice and it's clear deportation won't isn't going to keep him out. Therefore this person must be imprisoned to keep them off the streets."
1,"Things that are not crimes ie do not involve theft or assaulting people, or something that Bilderberg politicians do, do not deserve severe torture such as """"American prisons""""."
0,"i dont think it is worth sending him to jail. it would be good enough to just deport him."
0,"No reason for prison.  Worst case, the person should be deported or detained until he can file appropriate immigration paperwork."
0,"There is no reason to deport someone simply because they are illegal. Things are never this bad or needed"
0,"At worst, he should be deported.  Imprisonment within the US does nothing to rectify the illegal behavior."
1,"Because the person has already gone to prison twice for more than a year. Theres no reason a person should be walking around free when all they ever do is cause problems for everyone else."
1,"Since it was a violent crime he should spend time in prison accordingly. It is not that hard to be a respectful citizen that treats others with respect."
0,"This man did not commit a violent crime and our prisons are too crowded as it is. I think the man should just be given a certain amount of time to obtain legal citizenship."
0,"The government should give this man an option to get a visa if he has desirable skills. If he does not have desirable skills it would be better to deport him back to his home country, rather than putting him in prison."
1,"He should be sent to prison for his crime. After his prison term he should be sent back to his own country."
0,"I would need to know more about his situation. If he's escaping a bad situation, I don't believe he should be sent to prison."
1,"Since this is a repeat offender, I think he should serve jail time. At the end of his jail time, he should be deported back to his country. "
1,"He should be deported back to his home country in the next available flight. Sending him to prison is a  complete waste of time because he is a repeat offender."
1,"A short prison sentence (perhaps for 6 months) might serve as an effective deterrent to illegal immigrants with a demonstrated penchant for violence. My sense is that prison sentences should not be given to most illegal immigrants so long as there is effective enforcement of the border and those entering illegally are immediately deported, barring genuinely special circumstances, since it is not the responsibility of the US government to house and feed foreign nationals."
1,"He should not try to re-enter illegally after being deported and serving a prison term. As far as I know, once you are deported after serving a conviction, you are barred from entering the country for 10 years. If he re-entered illegally, he should go to prison for violating that mandate."
0,"I don't think he should be imprisoned. He was likely trying to get away from bad conditions in mexico and should be allowed to apply for citizenship in the U.S."
0,"It'll be the first lesson for him to obey the laws. Secondly, teach him to think before do the things. "
1,"Served  previous sentence. One of these sentence was a violent crime"
1,"He illegally entered. Illegal. He should either do jail time or jail time and then be deported to his country or origin. I don't understand why people who enter the country illegally think that they are entitled to anything other than a ticket home."
